This encyclopedia avoids\\nmedical jargon and uses language that laypersons\\ncan understand, while still providing thorough cover-\\nage of each topic. TheGale Encyclopedia of Medicine 3\\nfills a gap between basic consumer health resources,\\nsuch as single-volume family medical guides, and\\nhighly technical professional materials.\\nSCOPE\\nMore than 1,750 full-length articles are included\\nin theGale Encyclopedia of Medicine 3, including dis-\\norders/conditions, tests/procedures, and treatments/\\ntherapies. Many common drugs are also covered,\\nwith generic drug names appearing first and brand\\nnames following in parentheses, eg. acetaminophen\\n(Tylenol). Throughout the Gale Encyclopedia of\\nMedicine 3, many prominent individuals are high-\\nlighted as sidebar biographies that accompany the\\nmain topical essays. Articles follow a standardized\\nformat that provides information at a glance.\\nRubrics include:\\nDisorders/Conditions Tests/Treatments\\nDefinition Definition\\nDescription Purpose\\nCauses and symptoms Precautions\\nDiagnosis Description\\nTreatment Preparation\\nAlternative treatment Aftercare\\nPrognosis Risks\\nPrevention Normal/Abnormal results\\nResources Resources\\nKey terms Key terms\\nIn recent years there has been a resurgence of\\ninterest in holistic medicine that emphasizes the\\nconnection between mind and body. Aimed at achiev-\\ning and maintaining good health rather than just elim-\\ninating disease, this approach has come to be known\\nas alternative medicine. TheGale Encyclopedia of\\nMedicine 3 includes a number of essays on alterna-\\ntive therapies, ranging from traditional Chinese\\nmedicine to homeopathy and from meditation\\nto aromatherapy. In addition to full essays on alter-\\nnative therapies, the encyclopedia features specific\\nAlternative treatment sections for diseases and con-\\nditions that may be help ed by complementary\\ntherapies.\\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\\nA preliminary list of diseases, disorders, tests\\nand treatments was compiled from a wide variety of\\nsources, including professional medical guides and\\ntextbooks as well as consumer guides and encyclope-\\ndias. The general advisory board, made up of public\\nlibrarians, medical librarians and consumer health\\nexperts, evaluated the topics and made suggestions\\nfor inclusion. The list was sorted by category and\\nsent toGEM3 medical advisers, for review. Final selec-\\ntion of topics to include was made by the medical\\nadvisors in conjunction with the Thomson Gale\\neditor.\\nABOUT THE CONTRIBUTORS\\nThe essays were compiled by experienced medical\\nwriters, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses,\\nand other health care professionals.GEM3 medical\\nadvisors reviewed the completed essays to insure\\nthat they are appropriate, up-to-date, and medically\\naccurate.\\nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK\\nThe Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 3 has been\\ndesigned with ready reference in mind.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE xxi'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 23, 'page_label': '24'}, page_content='/C15Straight alphabetical arrangement allows users to\\nlocate information quickly.\\n/C15Bold faced terms function asprint hyperlinks that\\npoint the reader to related entries in the encyclopedia.\\n/C15Cross-references placed throughout the encyclope-\\ndia direct readers to where information on subjects\\nwithout entries can be found.

A trans-\\nmitter sends high frequency sound waves into the body,\\nwhere they bounce off the different tissues and organs\\nto produce a distinctive pattern of echoes. A receiver\\n‘‘hears’’ the returning echo pattern and forwards it to a\\ncomputer, which translates the data into an image on a\\ntelevision screen. Because ultrasound can distinguish\\nsubtle variations between soft, fluid-filled tissues, it is\\nparticularly useful in providing diagnostic images of the\\nabdomen. Ultrasound can also be used in treatment.\\nPurpose\\nThe potential medical applications of ultrasound\\nwere first recognized in the 1940s as an outgrowth of\\nthe sonar technology developed to detect submarines\\nduring World War II. The first useful medical images\\nwere produced in the early 1950s, and, by 1965, ultra-\\nsound quality had improved to the point that it came\\ninto general medical use. Improvements in the tech-\\nnology, application, and interpretation of ultrasound\\ncontinue. Its low cost, versatility, safety and speed\\nhave brought it into the top drawer of medical imaging\\ntechniques.\\nWhile pelvic ultrasoundis widely known and com-\\nmonly used for fetal monitoring duringpregnancy,\\nultrasound is also routinely used for general abdom-\\ninal imaging. It has great advantage over x-ray ima-\\nging technologies in that it does not damage tissues\\nwith ionizing radiation. Ultrasound is also generally\\nfar better than plain x rays at distinguishing the subtle\\nvariations of soft tissue structures, and can be used in\\nany of several modes, depending on the need at hand.\\nAs an imaging tool, abdominal ultrasound gener-\\nally is warranted for patients afflicted with: chronic or\\nacute abdominalpain; abdominal trauma; an obvious\\nor suspected abdominal mass; symptoms ofliver dis-\\nease, pancreatic disease,gallstones, spleen disease,kid-\\nney diseaseand urinary blockage; or symptoms of an\\nabdominal aortic aneurysm. Specifically:\\n/C15Abdominal pain. Whether acute or chronic, pain can\\nsignal a serious problem–from organ malfunction or\\ninjury to the presence of malignant growths.\\nUltrasound scanning can help doctors quickly sort\\nthrough potential causes when presented with gen-\\neral or ambiguous symptoms. All of the major\\nabdominal organs can be studied for signs of disease\\nthat appear as changes in size, shape and internal\\nstructure.\\n/C15Abdominal trauma. After a serious accident, such as\\na car crash or a fall, internal bleeding from injured\\nabdominal organs is often the most serious threat to\\nsurvival. Neither the injuries nor the bleeding are\\nimmediately apparent. Ultrasound is very useful as\\nan initial scan when abdominal trauma is suspected,\\nand it can be used to pinpoint the location, cause,\\nand severity of hemorrhaging. In the case of punc-\\nturewounds, from a bullet for example, ultrasound\\ncan locate the foreign object and provide a prelimin-\\nary survey of the damage. The easy portability and\\nversatility of ultrasound technology has brought it\\ninto common emergency room use, and even into\\nlimited ambulance service.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 1'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 31, 'page_label': '32'}, page_content='/C15Abdominal mass. Abnormal growths–tumors, cysts,\\nabscesses, scar tissue and accessory organs–can be\\nlocated and tentatively identified with ultrasound. In\\nparticular, potentially malignant solid tumors can be\\ndistinguished from benign fluid-filled cysts and\\nabscesses. Masses and malformations in any organ\\nor part of the abdomen can be found.\\n/C15Liver disease. The types and underlying causes of\\nliver disease are numerous, though jaundice tends\\nto be a general symptom. Ultrasound can differenti-\\nate between many of the types and causes of liver\\nmalfunction, and is particularly good at identifying\\nobstruction of the bile ducts andcirrhosis, which is\\ncharacterized by abnormal fibrous growths and\\nreduced blood flow.\\n/C15Pancreatic disease. Inflammation and malformation\\nof the pancreas are readily identified by ultrasound,\\nas are pancreatic stones (calculi), which can disrupt\\nproper functioning.\\n/C15Gallstones. Gallstones cause morehospital admissions\\nthan any other digestive malady. These calculi can\\ncause painful inflammation of the gallbladder and\\nalso obstruct the bile ducts that carry digestive enzymes\\nfrom the gallbladder and liver to the intestines.\\nGallstones are readily identifiable with ultrasound.\\n/C15Spleen disease. The spleen is particularly prone to\\ninjury during abdominal trauma. It may also become\\npainfully inflamed when beset with infection or\\ncancer. These conditions also lend themselves well\\nto ultrasonic inspection and diagnosis.\\n/C15Kidney disease. The kidneys are also prone to trau-\\nmatic injury and are the organs most likely to form\\ncalculi, which can block the flow of urine and cause\\nbloodpoisoning(uremia). A variety of diseases causing\\ndistinct changes in kidney morphology can also lead to\\ncomplete kidney failure. Ultrasound imaging has pro-\\nven extremely useful in diagnosing kidney disorders.\\n/C15Abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a bulging weak\\nspot in the abdominal aorta, which supplies blood\\ndirectly from the heart to the entire lower body.\\nThese aneurysms are relatively common and increase\\nin prevalence with age. A burst aortic aneurysm is\\nimminently life-threatening. However, they can be\\nreadily identified and monitored with ultrasound\\nbefore acute complications result.\\nUltrasound technology can also be used for treat-\\nment purposes, most frequently as a visual aid during\\nsurgical procedures–such as guiding needle placement\\nto drain fluid from a cyst, or to extract tumor cells for\\nbiopsy. Increasingly, direct therapeutic applications\\nfor ultrasound are being developed.\\nThe direct therapeutic value of ultrasonic waves\\nlies in their mechanical nature. They are shock waves,\\njust like audible sound, and vibrate the materials\\nthrough which they pass. These vibrations are mild,\\nvirtually unnoticeable at the frequencies and intensi-\\nties used for imaging. Properly focused however, high-\\nintensity ultrasound can be used to heat and physically\\nagitate targeted tissues.\\nHigh-intensity ultrasound is used routinely to treat\\nsoft tissue injuries, such asstrains,t e a r sa n da s s o c i a t e d\\nscarring. The heating and agitation are believed to\\npromote rapid healing through increased circulation.\\nStrongly focused, high-intensity, high-frequency ultra-\\nsound can also be used to physically destroy certain\\ntypes of tumors, as well as gallstones and other types\\nof calculi. Developing new treatment applications\\nfor ultrasound is an active area of medical research.\\nPrecautions\\nProperly performed, ultrasound imaging is vir-\\ntually without risk or side effects. Some patients report\\nfeeling a slighttingling and/or warmth while being\\nscanned, but most feel nothing at all. Ultrasound\\nwaves of appropriate frequency and intensity are not\\nknown to cause or aggravate any medical condition,\\nthough any woman who thinks she might be pregnant\\nshould raise the issue with her doctor before under-\\ngoing an abdominal ultrasound.\\nThe value of ultrasound imaging as a medical tool,\\nhowever, depends greatly on the quality of the equip-\\nment used and the skill of the medical personnel oper-\\nating it. Improperly performed and/or interpreted,\\nultrasound can be worse than useless if it indicates\\nthat a problem exists where there is none, or fails to\\ndetect a significant condition. Basic ultrasound equip-\\nment is relatively inexpensive to obtain, and any doc-\\ntor with the equipment can perform the procedure\\nwhether qualified or not. Patients should not hesitate\\nto verify the credentials of technicians and doctors\\nperforming ultrasounds, as well as the quality of the\\nequipment used and the benefits of the proposed\\nprocedure.\\nIn cases where ultrasound is used as a treatment\\ntool, patients should educate themselves about the\\nproposed procedure with the help of their doctors–as\\nis appropriate before any surgical procedure. Also,\\nany abdominal ultrasound procedure, diagnostic or\\ntherapeutic, may be hampered by a patient’s body\\ntype or other factors, such as the presence of excessive\\nbowel gas (which is opaque to ultrasound). In parti-\\ncular, very obese people are often not good candidates\\nfor abdominal ultrasound.\\n2 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAbdominal ultrasound'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 32, 'page_label': '33'}, page_content='Description\\nUltrasound includes all sound waves above the\\nfrequency of human hearing–about 20 thousand\\nhertz, or cycles per second. Medical ultrasound gener-\\nally uses frequencies between one and 10 million hertz\\n(1-10 MHz). Higher frequency ultrasound waves pro-\\nduce more detailed images, but are also more readily\\nabsorbed and so cannot penetrate as deeply into the\\nbody. Abdominal ultrasound imaging is generally per-\\nformed at frequencies between 2-5 MHz.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAccessory organ— A lump of tissue adjacent to an\\norgan that is similar to it, but which serves no impor-\\ntant purpose, if functional at all. While not necessa-\\nrily harmful, such organs can cause problems if they\\ngrow too large or become cancerous. In any case,\\ntheir presence points to an underlying abnormality in\\nthe parent organ.\\nBenign— In medical usage, benign is the opposite of\\nmalignant. It describes an abnormal growth that is\\nstable, treatable and generally not life-threatening.\\nBiopsy— The surgical removal and analysis of a\\ntissue sample for diagnostic purposes. Usually, the\\nterm refers to the collection and analysis of tissue\\nfrom a suspected tumor to establish malignancy.\\nCalculus— Any type of hard concretion (stone) in the\\nbody, but usually found in the gallbladder, pancreas\\nand kidneys. They are formed by the accumulation of\\nexcess mineral salts and other organic material such\\nas blood or mucous. Calculi (pl.) can cause problems\\nby lodging in and obstructing the proper flow of fluids,\\nsuch as bile to the intestines or urine to the bladder.\\nCirrhosis— A chronic liver disease characterized by\\nthe invasion of connective tissue and the degenera-\\ntion of proper functioning–jaundice is often an\\naccompanying symptom. Causes of cirrhosis include\\nalcoholism, metabolic diseases, syphilis and conges-\\ntive heart disease.\\nCommon bile duct— The branching passage through\\nwhich bile–a necessary digestive enzyme–travels\\nfrom the liver and gallbladder into the small intes-\\ntine. Digestive enzymes from the pancreas also enter\\nthe intestines through the common bile duct.\\nComputed tomography scan (CT scan)— As p e c i a -\\nlized type of x-ray imaging that uses highly focused\\nand relatively low energy radiation to produce detailed\\ntwo-dimensional images of soft tissue structures, parti-\\ncularly the brain. CT scans are the chief competitor to\\nultrasound and can yield higher quality images not\\nd i s r u p t e db yb o n eo rg a s .T h e ya r e ,h o w e v e r ,m o r e\\ncumbersome, time consuming and expensive to per-\\nform, and they use ionizing electromagnetic radiation.\\nDoppler— The Doppler effect refers to the apparent\\nchange in frequency of sound wave echoes returning\\nto a stationary source from a moving target. If the\\nobject is moving toward the source, the frequency\\nincreases; if the object is moving away, the fre-\\nquency decreases. The size of this frequency shift\\ncan be used to compute the object’s speed–be it a\\ncar on the road or blood in an artery. The Doppler\\neffect holds true for all types of radiation, not just\\nsound.\\nFrequency— Sound, whether traveling through air or\\nthe human body, produces vibrations–molecules\\nbouncing into each other–as the shock wave travels\\nalong. The frequency of a sound is the number of\\nvibrations per second. Within the audible range,\\nfrequency means pitch–the higher the frequency,\\nthe higher a sound’s pitch.\\nIonizing radiation— Radiation that can damage liv-\\ning tissue by disrupting and destroying individual\\ncells at the molecular level. All types of nuclear\\nradiation–x rays, gamma rays and beta rays–are\\npotentially ionizing. Sound waves physically vibrate\\nthe material through which they pass, but do not\\nionize it.\\nJaundice— A condition that results in a yellow tint to\\nthe skin, eyes and body fluids. Bile retention in the\\nliver, gallbladder and pancreas is the immediate\\ncause, but the underlying cause could be as simple\\nas obstruction of the common bile duct by a gall-\\nstone or as serious as pancreatic cancer. Ultrasound\\ncan distinguish between these conditions.\\nMalignant— The term literally means growing worse\\nand resisting treatment.

In medi-\\ncine, morphology refers to the size, shape and struc-\\nture rather than the function of a given organ.

The transducer both pro-\\nduces the sound waves that penetrate the body and\\nreceives the reflected echoes. Transducers are built\\naround piezoelectric ceramic chips. (Piezoelectric\\nrefers to electricity that is produced when you put\\npressure on certain crystals such as quartz). These\\nceramic chips react to electric pulses by producing\\nsound waves ( they are transmitting waves) and react\\nto sound waves by producing electric pulses (receiv-\\ning). Bursts of high frequency electric pulses supplied\\nto the transducer causes it to produce the scanning\\nsound waves. The transducer then receives the return-\\ning echoes, translates them back into electric pulses\\nand sends them to the analyzer–a computer that orga-\\nnizes the data into an image on a television screen.\\nBecause sound waves travel through all the body’s\\ntissues at nearly the same speed–about 3,400 miles per\\nhour–the microseconds it takes for each echo to be\\nreceived can be plotted on the screen as a distance into\\nthe body. The relative strength of each echo, a func-\\ntion of the specific tissue or organ boundary that\\nproduced it, can be plotted as a point of varying\\nbrightness. In this way, the echoes are translated into\\na picture. Tissues surrounded by bone or filled with\\ngas (the stomach, intestines and bowel) cannot be\\nimaged using ultrasound, because the waves are\\nblocked or become randomly scattered.\\nFour different modes of ultrasound are used in\\nmedical imaging:\\n/C15A-mode. This is the simplest type of ultrasound in\\nwhich a single transducer scans a line through the\\nbody with the echoes plotted on screen as a function\\nof depth. This method is used to measure distances\\nwithin the body and the size of internal organs.\\nTherapeutic ultrasound aimed at a specific tumor\\nor calculus is also A-mode, to allow for pinpoint\\naccurate focus of the destructive wave energy.\\n/C15B-mode. In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of\\ntransducers simultaneously scans a plane through\\nthe body that can be viewed as a two-dimensional\\nimage on screen. Ultrasound probes containing more\\nthan 100 transducers in sequence form the basis for\\nthese most commonly used scanners, which cost\\nabout $50,000.\\n/C15M-Mode. The M stands for motion. A rapid\\nsequence of B-mode scans whose images follow\\neach other in sequence on screen enables doctors to\\nsee and measure range of motion, as the organ\\nboundaries that produce reflections move relative\\nto the probe. M-mode ultrasound has been put to\\nparticular use in studying heart motion.\\n/C15Doppler mode.Doppler ultrasonographyincludes the\\ncapability of accurately measuring velocities of mov-\\ning material, such as blood in arteries and veins. The\\nprinciple is the same as that used in radar guns that\\nmeasure the speed of a car on the highway. Doppler\\ncapability is most often combined with B-mode scan-\\nning to produce images of blood vessels from which\\nblood flow can be directly measured. This technique\\nis used extensively to investigate valve defects, arter-\\niosclerosis and hypertension, particularly in the\\nheart, but also in the abdominal aorta and the portal\\nvein of the liver. These machines cost about\\n$250,000.\\nThe actual procedure for a patient undergoing an\\nabdominal ultrasound is relatively simple, regardless\\nof the type of scan or its purpose.Fasting for at least\\neight hours prior to the procedure ensures that the\\nstomach is empty and as small as possible, and that\\nthe intestines and bowels are relatively inactive.\\nFasting also allows the gall bladder to be seen, as it\\ncontracts after eating and may not be seen if the sto-\\nmach is full. In some cases, a full bladder helps to push\\nintestinal folds out of the way so that the gas they\\ncontain does not disrupt the image. The patient’s\\nabdomen is then greased with a special gel that allows\\nthe ultrasound probe to glide easily across the skin\\nwhile transmitting and receiving ultrasonic pulses.\\nThis procedure is conducted by a doctor with the\\nassistance of a technologist skilled in operating the\\nequipment. The probe is moved around the abdomen\\nto obtain different views of the target areas. The\\npatient will likely be asked to change positions from\\nside to side and to hold their breath as necessary to\\nobtain the desired views. Discomfort during the pro-\\ncedure is minimal.\\nThe many types and uses of ultrasound technol-\\nogy makes it difficult to generalize about the time and\\ncosts involved. Relatively simple imaging–scanning a\\nsuspicious abdominal mass or a suspected abdominal\\naortic aneurysm–will take about half an hour to per-\\nform and will cost a few hundred dollars or more,\\ndepending on the quality of the equipment, the\\noperator and other factors. More involved techniques\\nsuch as multiple M-mode and Doppler-enhanced\\nscans, or cases where the targets not well defined in\\nadvance, generally take more time and are more\\nexpensive.\\nRegardless of the type of scan used and the potential\\ndifficulties encountered, ultrasound remains faster and\\nless expensive than computed tomography scans (CT),\\nits primary rival in abdominal imaging.

It occurs in a rare\\npercentage of pregnancies.\\nPurpose\\nPartial birth abortion, or D&X, is performed to\\nend a pregnancy and results in the death of a fetus,\\ntypically in the late second or third trimester.\\nAlthough D&X is highly controversial, some physi-\\ncians argue that it has advantages that make it a pre-\\nferable procedure in some circumstances. One\\nperceived advantage is that the fetus is removed\\nlargely intact, allowing for better evaluation and\\nautopsy of the fetus in cases of known fetal abnormal-\\nities. Intact removal of the fetus also may carry a lower\\nrisk of puncturing the uterus or damaging the cervix.\\nAnother perceived advantage is that D&X ends the\\npregnancy without requiring the woman to go\\nthrough labor, which may be less emotionally trau-\\nmatic than other methods of late-term abortion.

A con-\\ntroversy common to all late-term abortions is whether\\nthe fetus is viable, or able to survive outside of the\\nwoman’s body. A specific area of controversy with\\nD&X is that fetal death does not occur until after\\nmost of the fetal body has exited the uterus. Several\\nstates have taken legal action to limit or ban D&X and\\nmany physicians who perform abortions do not per-\\nform D&X. This may restrict the availability of this\\nprocedure to women seeking late-term abortions.\\nIn March 2003, the United States Senate passed a\\nbill banning partial birth abortions and implementing\\nfines or maximum two-year jail terms for physicians\\nwho perform them. In June 2003, the House approved\\na ban as well. President George W. Bush signed the\\nlegislation into law, but a federal judge declared the\\nlaw unconstitutional, so that the government had not\\nbeen able to enforce it. One of the opponents’ claims\\nwas the legislation did not provide for exceptions for\\ncases in which the procedure was needed to protect the\\nmother’s health.\\nDescription\\nIntact D&X, or partial birth abortion first\\ninvolves administration of medications to cause the\\ncervix to dilate, usually over the course of several\\ndays. Next, the physician rotates the fetus to a footling\\nbreech position. The body of the fetus is then drawn\\nout of the uterus feet first, until only the head remains\\ninside the uterus. Then, the physician uses an instru-\\nment to puncture the base of the skull, which collapses\\nthe fetal head. Typically, the contents of the fetal head\\nare then partially suctioned out, which results in the\\ndeath of the fetus and reduces the size of the fetal head\\nenough to allow it to pass through the cervix. The dead\\nand otherwise intact fetus is then removed from the\\nwoman’s body.\\nPreparation\\nMedical preparation for D&X involves an out-\\npatient visit to administer medications, such aslami-\\nnaria, to cause the cervix to begin dilating.\\nIn addition, preparation may involve fulfilling\\nlocal legal requirements, such as a mandatory waiting\\nperiod, counseling, or an informed consent procedure\\nreviewing stages of fetal development,childbirth, alter-\\nnative abortion methods, and adoption.\\nAftercare\\nD&X typically does not require an overnight hos-\\npital stay, so a follow up appointment may be sched-\\nuled to monitor the woman for any complications.\\nRisks\\nWith all abortion, the later in pregnancy an abor-\\ntion is performed, the more complicated the procedure\\nand the greater the risk of injury to the woman. In\\naddition to associated emotional reactions, D&X car-\\nries the risk of injury to the woman, including heavy\\nbleeding, blood clots, damage to the cervix or uterus,\\npelvic infection, and anesthesia-related complications.\\nThere also is a risk of incomplete abortion, meaning\\nthat the fetus is not dead when removed from the\\nwoman’s body.

Dugan, M.S.\\nTeresa G. Odle\\nAbortion, selective\\nDefinition\\nSelective abortion, also known as selective reduc-\\ntion, refers to choosing to abort a fetus, typically in a\\nmulti-fetalpregnancy, to decrease the health risks to\\nthe mother in carrying and giving birth to more than\\none or two babies, and also to decrease the risk of\\ncomplications to the remaining fetus(es). The term\\nselective abortion also refers to choosing to abort a\\nfetus for reasons such as the woman is carrying a fetus\\nwhich likely will be born with some birth defect or\\nimpairment, or because the sex of the fetus is not\\npreferred by the individual.\\nPurpose\\nA woman may decide to abort for health reasons,\\nfor example, she is at higher risk for complications\\nduring pregnancy because of a disorder or disease\\nsuch as diabetes. A 2004 case reported on an embryo\\nembedded in acesarean sectionscar. Although rare, it\\ncan be life threatening to the mother. In this care,\\nselective abortion was successful at saving the mother\\nand the remaining embryos.\\nHowever, selective reduction is recommended\\noften in cases of multi-fetal pregnancy, or the presence\\nof more than one fetus, typically, at least three or more\\nfetuses. In the general population, multi-fetal preg-\\nnancy happens in only about 1-2% of pregnant\\nwomen. But multi-fetal pregnancies occur far more\\noften in women using fertility drugs.\\nPrecautions\\nBecause women or couples who use fertility drugs\\nhave made an extra effort to become pregnant, it is\\npossible that the individuals may be unwilling or\\nuncomfortable with the decision to abort a fetus in\\ncases of multi-fetal pregnancy. Individuals engaging in\\nfertility treatment should be made aware of the risk of\\nmulti-fetal pregnancy and consider the prospect of\\nrecommended reduction before undergoing fertility\\ntreatment.\\nDescription\\nSelective reduction is usually performed between\\nnine and 12 weeks of pregnancy and is most successful\\nwhen performed in early pregnancy. It is a simple\\nprocedure and can be performed on an outpatient\\nbasis. A needle is inserted into the woman’s stomach\\nor vagina and potassium chloride is injected into the\\nfetus.\\nPreparation\\nIndividuals who have chosen selective reduction\\nto safeguard the remaining fetuses should be coun-\\nseled prior to the procedure. Individuals should\\nreceive information regarding the risks of a multi-\\nfetal pregnancy to both the fetuses and the mother\\ncompared with the risks after the reduction.\\nIndividuals seeking an abortion for any reason\\nshould consider the ethical implications whether it be\\nbecause the fetus is not the preferred sex or because the\\nfetus would be born with a severe birth defect.\\nAftercare\\nCounseling should continue after the abortion\\nbecause it is a traumatic event.

Odle\\nAbortion, spontaneous see Miscarriage\\nAbortion, therapeutic\\nDefinition\\nTherapeutic abortion is the intentional termina-\\ntion of apregnancy before the fetus can live indepen-\\ndently. Abortion has been a legal procedure in the\\nUnited States since 1973.\\nPurpose\\nAn abortion may be performed whenever there is\\nsome compelling reason to end a pregnancy. Women\\nhave abortions because continuing the pregnancy\\nwould cause them hardship, endanger their life or\\nhealth, or because prenatal testing has shown that\\nthe fetus will be born with severe abnormalities.\\nAbortions are safest when performed within the\\nfirst six to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period.\\nThe calculation of this date is referred to as the\\ngestational age and is used in determining the stage\\nof pregnancy. For example, a woman who is two\\nweeks late having her period is said to be six weeks\\npregnant, because it is six weeks since she last\\nmenstruated.\\nAbout 90% of women who have abortions do so\\nbefore 13 weeks and experience few complications.\\nAbortions performed between 13-24 weeks have a\\nhigher rate of complications. Abortions after 24\\nweeks are extremely rare and are usually limited to\\nsituations where the life of the mother is in danger.\\nPrecautions\\nMost women are able to have abortions at clinics\\nor outpatient facilities if the procedure is performed\\nearly in pregnancy. Women who have stable diabetes,\\ncontrolled epilepsy, mild to moderate high blood pres-\\nsure, or who are HIV positive can often have abortions\\nas outpatients if precautions are taken. Women with\\nheart disease, previousendocarditis, asthma,l u p u s\\nerythematosus, uterine fibroid tumors, blood clotting\\ndisorders, poorly controlled epilepsy, or some psycho-\\nlogical disorders usually need to be hospitalized in\\norder to receive special monitoring and medications\\nduring the procedure.\\nDescription\\nVery early abortions\\nBetween five and seven weeks, a pregnancy can be\\nended by a procedure called menstrual extraction.\\nThis procedure is also sometimes called menstrual\\nregulation, mini-suction, or preemptive abortion.\\nThe contents of the uterus are suctioned out through\\na thin (3-4 mm) plastic tube that is inserted through the\\nundilated cervix. Suction is applied either by a bulb\\nsyringe or a small pump.\\nAnother method is called the ‘‘morning after’’ pill,\\nor emergency contraception. Basically, it involves tak-\\ning high doses of birth control pills within 24 to 48\\nhours of having unprotected sex. The high doses of\\nhormones causes the uterine lining to change so that it\\nwill not support a pregnancy. Thus, if the egg has been\\nfertilized, it is simply expelled from the body.\\nThere are two types of emergencycontraception.\\nOne type is identical to ordinary birth control pills,\\nand uses the hormones estrogen and progestin).

After an observation period, she\\nreturns home.\\nWithin four days, 90% of women have expelled\\nthe contents of their uterus and completed the abor-\\ntion. Within 14 days, 95-97% of women have com-\\npleted the abortion. A third follow-up visit to the\\ndoctor is necessary to confirm through observation\\nor ultrasound that the procedure is complete. In the\\nevent that it is not, a surgical abortion is performed.\\nStudies show that 4.5 to 8 percent of women need\\nsurgery or a bloodtransfusion after taking mifepris-\\ntone, and the pregnancy persists in about 1 percent of\\nwomen. In this case, surgical abortion is recom-\\nmended because the fetus may be damanged. Side\\neffects include nausea, vaginal bleeding and heavy\\ncramping. The bleeding is typically heavier than a\\nnormal period and may last up to 16 days.\\nMifepristone is not recommended for women with\\nectopic pregnancy, an IUD, who have been taking\\nlong-term steroidal therapy, have bleeding abnormal-\\nities or on blood-thinners such as Coumadin.\\nSurgical abortions\\nFirst trimester surgical abortions are performed\\nusing vacuum aspiration. The procedure is also called\\ndilation and evacuation (D & E), suction dilation,\\nvacuum curettage, or suction curettage.\\nAdvantages of a vacuum aspiration abortion are:\\n/C15It is usually done as a one-day outpatient procedure.\\n/C15The procedure takes only 10-15 minutes.\\n/C15Bleeding after the abortion lasts five days or less.\\n/C15The woman does not see the products of her womb\\nbeing removed.\\nDisadvantages include:\\n/C15The procedure is invasive; surgical instruments are\\nused.\\n/C15Infection may occur.\\nDuring a vacuum aspiration, the woman’s cervix\\nis gradually dilated by expanding rods inserted into\\nthe cervical opening. Once dilated, a tube attached to a\\nsuction pump is inserted through the cervix and the\\ncontents of the uterus are suctioned out. The proce-\\ndure is 97-99% effective. The amount of discomfort a\\nwoman feels varies considerably.Local anesthesia is\\noften given to numb the cervix, but it does not mask\\nuterine cramping. After a few hours of rest, the woman\\nmay return home.\\nSecond trimester abortions\\nAlthough it is better to have an abortion during\\nthe first trimester, some second trimester abortions\\nmay be inevitable. The results ofgenetic testing are\\noften not available until 16 weeks. In addition,\\nwomen, especially teens, may not have recognized\\nthe pregnancy or come to terms with it emotionally\\nsoon enough to have a first trimester abortion.

The doctor may prescribe\\nantibiotics to reduce the chance of infection. Women\\nwho are Rh negative (lacking genetically determined\\nantigens in their red blood cells that produce immune\\nresponses) should be given a human Rh immune\\nglobulin (RhoGAM) after the procedure unless the\\nfather of the fetus is also Rh negative.

It is the\\nresult of the body’s defensive reaction to foreign\\nmaterial.\\nDescription\\nThere are two types of abscesses, septic and sterile.\\nMost abscesses are septic, which means that they are\\nthe result of an infection. Septic abscesses can occur\\nanywhere in the body. Only a germ and the body’s\\nimmune response are required. In response to the\\ninvading germ, white blood cells gather at the infected\\nsite and begin producing chemicals called enzymes\\nthat attack the germ by digesting it. These enzymes\\nact like acid, killing the germs and breaking them\\ndown into small pieces that can be picked up by\\nthe circulation and eliminated from the body.\\nUnfortunately, these chemicals also digest body tis-\\nsues. In most cases, the germ produces similar chemi-\\ncals. The result is a thick, yellow liquid–pus–\\ncontaining digested germs, digested tissue, white\\nblood cells, and enzymes.\\nAn abscess is the last stage of a tissue infection\\nthat begins with a process called inflammation.\\nInitially, as the invading germ activates the body’s\\nimmune system, several events occur:\\n/C15Blood flow to the area increases.\\n/C15The temperature of the area increases due to the\\nincreased blood supply.\\n/C15The area swells due to the accumulation of water,\\nblood, and other liquids.\\n/C15It turns red.\\n/C15It hurts, because of the irritation from the swelling\\nand the chemical activity.\\nThese four signs–heat, swelling, redness, and\\npain–characterize inflammation.\\nAs the process progresses, the tissue begins to turn\\nto liquid, and an abscess forms. It is the nature of an\\nabscess to spread as the chemical digestion liquefies\\nmore and more tissue. Furthermore, the spreading\\nfollows the path of least resistance–the tissues most\\neasily digested. A good example is an abscess just\\nbeneath the skin. It most easily continues along\\nbeneath the skin rather than working its way through\\nthe skin where it could drain its toxic contents. The\\ncontents of the abscess also leak into the general cir-\\nculation and produce symptoms just like any other\\ninfection. These include chills,fever, aching, and\\ngeneral discomfort.\\nSterile abscesses are sometimes a milder form\\nof the same process caused not by germs but by non-\\nliving irritants such as drugs. If an injected drug\\nlike penicillin is not absorbed, it stays where it was\\nAn amoebic abscess caused by Entameoba histolytica .\\n(Phototake NYC.

Sterile abscesses are quite likely to turn into\\nhard, solid lumps as they scar, rather than remaining\\npockets of pus.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMany different agents cause abscesses. The most\\ncommon are the pus-forming (pyogenic) bacteria like\\nStaphylococcus aureus, which is nearly always the\\ncause of abscesses under the skin. Abscesses near\\nthe large bowel, particularly around the anus, may\\nbe caused by any of the numerous bacteria found\\nwithin the large bowel. Brain abscesses and liver\\nabscesses can be caused by any organism that can\\ntravel there through the circulation. Bacteria,\\namoeba, and certain fungi can travel in this fashion.\\nAbscesses in other parts of the body are caused by\\norganisms that normally inhabit nearby structures or\\nthat infect them. Some common causes of specific\\nabscesses are:\\n/C15skin abscesses by normal skin flora\\n/C15dental and throat abscesses by mouth flora\\n/C15lung abscesses by normal airway flora,pneumonia\\ngerms, or tuberculosis\\n/C15abdominal and anal abscesses by normal bowel\\nflora\\nSpecific types of abscesses\\nListed below are some of the more common and\\nimportant abscesses.\\n/C15Carbuncles and otherboils. Skin oil glands (sebac-\\neous glands) on the back or the back of the neck\\nare the ones usually infected. The most common\\ngerm involved is Staphylococcus aureus . Acne is a\\nsimilar condition of sebaceous glands on the face\\nand back.\\n/C15Pilonidal abscess. Many people have as a birth defect\\na tiny opening in the skin just above the anus. Fecal\\nbacteria can enter this opening, causing an infection\\nand subsequent abscess.\\n/C15Retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, peritonsillar\\nabscess. As a result of throat infections like strep\\nthroat andtonsillitis, bacteria can invade the deeper\\ntissues of the throat and cause an abscess. These\\nabscesses can compromise swallowing and even\\nbreathing.\\n/C15Lung abscess. During or after pneumonia, whether\\nit’s due to bacteria [common pneumonia], tubercu-\\nlosis, fungi, parasites, or other germs, abscesses can\\ndevelop as a complication.\\n/C15Liver abscess. Bacteria or amoeba from the intestines\\ncan spread through the blood to the liver and cause\\nabscesses.\\n/C15Psoas abscess. Deep in the back of the abdomen on\\neither side of the lumbar spine lie the psoas muscles.\\nThey flex the hips. An abscess can develop in one of\\nthese muscles, usually when it spreads from the\\nappendix, the large bowel, or the fallopian tubes.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe common findings of inflammation–heat, red-\\nness, swelling, and pain–easily identify superficial\\nabscesses. Abscesses in other places may produce\\nonly generalized symptoms such as fever and discom-\\nfort. If the patient’s symptoms and physical examina-\\ntion do not help, a physician may have to resort to a\\nbattery of tests to locate the site of an abscess, but\\nusually something in the initial evaluation directs the\\nsearch. Recent or chronic disease in an organ suggests\\nit may be the site of an abscess. Dysfunction of an\\norgan or system–for instance, seizures or altered bowel\\nfunction–may provide the clue.Pain and tenderness\\non physical examination are common findings.\\nSometimes a deep abscess will eat a small channel\\n(sinus) to the surface and begin leaking pus.

Thus, the pus must be drained from the\\nabscess by a physician. The surgeon determines when\\nthe abscess is ready for drainage and opens a path to\\nthe outside, allowing the pus to escape. Ordinarily, the\\nbody handles the remaining infection, sometimes with\\nthe help ofantibiotics or other drugs. The surgeon may\\nleave a drain (a piece of cloth or rubber) in the abscess\\ncavity to prevent it from closing before all the pus has\\ndrained out.\\nAlternative treatment\\nIf an abscess is directly beneath the skin, it will be\\nslowly working its way through the skin as it is more\\nrapidly working its way elsewhere. Since chemicals\\nwork faster at higher temperatures, applications of\\nhot compresses to the skin over the abscess will hasten\\nthe digestion of the skin and eventually result in its\\nbreaking down, releasing the pus spontaneously. This\\ntreatment is best reserved for smaller abscesses in rela-\\ntively less dangerous areas of the body–limbs, trunk,\\nback of the neck. It is also useful for all superficial\\nabscesses in their very early stages. It will ‘‘ripen’’\\nthem.\\nContrast hydrotherapy, alternating hot and\\ncold compresses, can also help assist the body in\\nresorption of the abscess. There are two homeo-\\npathic remedies that work to rebalance the body in\\nrelation to abscess formation, Silica and Hepar\\nsulphuris . In cases of septic abscesses, bentonite\\nclay packs (bentonite clay and a small amount of\\nHydrastispowder) can be used to draw the infection\\nfrom the area.\\nPrognosis\\nOnce the abscess is properly drained, the prog-\\nnosis is excellent for the condition itself. The reason\\nfor the abscess (other diseases the patient has) will\\ndetermine the overall outcome.

In either\\ncase, the result is life threatening.

Turkington\\nAbuse\\nDefinition\\nAbuse is defined as anything that is harmful,\\ninjurious, or offensive. Abuse also includes excessive\\nand wrongful misuse of a substance. There are several\\nmajor types of abuse: physical and sexual abuse of a\\nchild or an adult,substance abuse, elderly abuse, and\\nemotional abuse.\\nDescription\\nPhysical abuse of a child is the infliction of injury\\nby another person. The injuries can include punching,\\nkicking, biting, burning, beating, or pulling the vic-\\ntim’s hair. The physical abuse inflicted on a child can\\nresult inbruises, burns, poisoning, broken bones, and\\ninternal hemorrhages. Physical assault against an\\nadult primarily occurs with women, usually in the\\nform of domestic violence. It is estimated that approxi-\\nmately three million children witness domestic vio-\\nlence every year.\\nSexual abuse of a child refers to sexual behavior\\nbetween an adult and child or between two children,\\none of whom is dominant or significantly older. The\\nsexual behaviors can include touching breasts, geni-\\ntals, and buttocks; either dressed or undressed. The\\nbehavior also can include exhibitionism, cunnilingus,\\nfellatio, or penetration of the vagina or anus with\\nsexual organs or objects.\\nPornographic photography also is used in sexual\\nabuse with children. Reported sex offenders are 97%\\nmale. Reports of child pornography have increased\\nsince with the popularity of the Internet. Females\\nmore often are perpetrators in child-care settings,\\nsince children may confuse sexual abuse by a female\\nwith normal hygiene care. The 1990s and early 2000s\\nwere rocked by reports of sexual abuse of children\\ncommitted by Catholic priests. Most of the abuse\\nappeared to have occurred during the 1970s and a\\nprominent report released early in 2004 stated that as\\nmany as 10.667 children were sexually abused by more\\nthan 4,300 priests. Sexual abuse by stepfathers is five\\ntimes more common than with biological fathers.\\nSexual abuse of daughters by stepfathers or fathers is\\nthe most common form of incest.\\nSexual abuse also can take the form ofrape. The\\nlegal definition of rape includes only slight penile\\npenetration in the victim’s outer vulva area.\\nComplete erection and ejaculation are not necessary.\\nRape is the perpetration of an act of sexual intercourse\\nwhether:\\n/C15will is overcome by force or fear (from threats or by\\nuse of drugs).\\n/C15mental impairment renders the victim incapable of\\nrational judgment.\\n/C15if the victim is below the legal age established for\\nconsent.\\nSubstance abuse is an abnormal pattern of sub-\\nstance usage leading to significant distress or impair-\\nment.

Elderly patients also may exhibit financial\\nabuse (money or possessions taken away) and\\nabandonment.\\nEmotional abuse generally continues even after\\nphysical assaults have stopped. In most cases it is a\\npersonally tailored form of verbal or gesture abuse\\nexpressed to illicit a provoked response.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nChildren who have been abused usually have a\\nvariety of symptoms that encompass behavioral, emo-\\ntional, and psychosomatic problems (body problems\\ncaused by emotional or mental disturbance). Children\\nwho have been physically abused tend to be more\\naggressive, angry, hostile, depressed, and have low\\nself-esteem. Additionally, they exhibit fear,anxiety,\\nand nightmares. Severe psychological problems may\\nresult in suicidal behavior or posttraumatic stress dis-\\norder. Physically abused children may complain of\\nphysical illness even in the absence of a cause. They\\nalso may suffer from eating disorders andencopresis,\\nor involuntary defecation caused or psychic origin.\\nChildren who are sexually abused may exhibit abnor-\\nmal sexual behavior in the form of aggressiveness and\\nhyperarousal. Adolescents may display promiscuity,\\nsexual acting out, and—in some situations—homo-\\nsexual contact.\\nPhysical abuse directed towards adults can ulti-\\nmately lead todeath. Approximately 50% of women\\nmurdered in the United States were killed by a former\\nor current male partner. Approximately one-third of\\nemergency room consultations by women were\\nprompted due to domestic violence. Female victims\\nwho are married also have a higher rate of internal\\ninjuries and unconsciousness than victims of stranger\\nassault (mugging, robbery). Physical abuse or rape\\nalso can occur between married persons and persons\\nof the same gender. Perpetrators usually sexually\\nassault their victims to dominate, hurt, and debase\\nthem. It is common for physical and sexual violence\\nto occur at the same time. A large percentage of sexu-\\nally assaulted persons were also physically abused in\\nthe form of punching, beating, or threatening the vic-\\ntim with a weapon such as a gun or knife. Usually\\nmales who are hurt and humiliated tend to physically\\nassault people whom they are intimately involved\\nwith, such as spouses and/or children. Males who\\nassault a female tend to have experienced or witnessed\\nviolence during childhood. They also tend to abuse\\nalcohol, to be sexually assaultive, and are at increased\\nrisk for assaultive behavior directed against children.\\nJealous males tend to monitor a women’s movements\\nand whereabouts and to isolate other sources of pro-\\ntection and support. They interpret their behavior as\\nbetrayal of trust and this causes resentment and explo-\\nsive anger outbursts during periods of losing control.\\nMales also may use aggression against females in an\\neffort to control and intimidate partners.\\nAbuse in the elderly usually occurs in the frail,\\nelderly community. The caretaker is usually the perpe-\\ntrator. Caretaker abuse can be suspected if there is\\nevidence suggesting behavioral changes in the elderly\\nperson when the caretaker is present. Additionally,\\nelderly abuse can be possible if there are delays\\nbetween injuries and treatment, inconsistencies\\nbetween injury and explanations, lack of hygiene or\\nclothing, and prescriptions not being filled.\\nDiagnosis\\nChildren who are victims of domestic violence\\nfrequently are injured attempting to protect their\\nmother from an abusive partner. Injuries are visible\\nby inspection or self-report. Physical abuse of an adult\\nmay also be evident by inspection with visible cuts\\nand/or bruises or self-report.\\nSexual abuse of both a child and an adult can be\\ndiagnosed with a history from the victim. Victims can\\nbe assessed for signs of ejaculatory evidence from the\\nperpetrator. Ejaculatory specimens can be retrieved\\nfrom the mouth, rectum, and clothing.

A ring of muscle called the\\nlower esophageal sphincter encircles the esophagus\\njust above the entrance to the stomach. This sphincter\\nmuscle is normally contracted to close the esophagus.\\nWhen the sphincter is closed, the contents of the sto-\\nmach cannot flow back into the esophagus. Backward\\nflow of stomach contents (reflux) can irritate and\\ninflame the esophagus, causing symptoms such as\\nheartburn. The act of swallowing causes a wave of\\nesophageal contraction called peristalsis. Peristalsis\\npushes food along the esophagus. Normally, peristal-\\nsis causes the esophageal sphincter to relax and allow\\nfood into the stomach. In achalasia, which means\\n‘‘failure to relax,’’ the esophageal sphincter remains\\ncontracted. Normal peristalsis is interrupted and food\\ncannot enter the stomach.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAchalasia is caused by degeneration of the nerve\\ncells that normally signal the brain to relax the\\nesophageal sphincter. The ultimate cause of this\\ndegeneration is unknown. Autoimmune disease or\\nhidden infection is suspected.\\nSymptoms\\nDysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is the most\\ncommon symptom of achalasia. The person with\\nachalasia usually has trouble swallowing both liquid\\nand solid foods, often feeling that food ‘‘gets stuck’’\\non the way down. The person has chestpain that\\nis often mistaken forangina pectoris (cardiac pain).\\nHeartburn and difficulty belching are common.\\nSymptoms usually get steadily worse. Other symptoms\\nmay include nighttimecough or recurrentpneumonia\\ncaused by food passing into the lower airways.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of achalasia begins with a careful med-\\nical history. The history should focus on the timing of\\nsymptoms and on eliminating other medical condi-\\ntions that may cause similar symptoms. Tests used to\\ndiagnose achalasia include:\\n/C15Esophageal manometry. In this test, a thin tube is\\npassed into the esophagus to measure the pressure\\nexerted by the esophageal sphincter.\\n/C15X ray of the esophagus. Barium may be swallowed to\\nact as a contrast agent. Barium reveals the outlines of\\nthe esophagus in greater detail and makes it easier to\\nsee its constriction at the sphincter.\\n/C15Endoscopy. In this test, a tube containing a lens and a\\nlight source is passed into the esophagus. Endoscopy is\\nused to look directly at the surface of the esophagus.\\nThis test can also detect tumors that cause symptoms\\nlike those of achalasia. Cancer of the esophagus occurs\\nas a complication of achalasia in 2-7% of patients.\\nTreatment\\nThe first-line treatment for achalasia is balloon\\ndilation. In this procedure, an inflatable membrane\\nor balloon is passed down the esophagus to the sphinc-\\nter and inflated to force the sphincter open. Dilation is\\neffective in about 70% of patients.\\nThree other treatments are used for achalasia when\\nballoon dilation is inappropriate or unacceptable.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21\\nAchalasia'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 51, 'page_label': '52'}, page_content='/C15Botulinum toxin injection.

The disorder\\nappears in approximately one in every 10,000\\nbirths. Achondroplasia is usually diagnosed at birth,\\nowing to the characteristic appearance of the\\nnewborn.\\nNormal bone growth depends on the produc-\\ntion of cartilage (a fibrous connective tissue). Over\\ntime, calcium is deposited within the cartilage,\\ncausing it to harden and become bone. In achon-\\ndroplasia, abnormalities of this process prevent the\\nbones (especially those in the limbs) from growing\\nas long as they normally should, at the same time\\nallowing the bones to become abnormally thick-\\nened. The bones in the trunk of the body and the\\nskull are mostly not affected, although the opening\\nfrom the skull through which the spinal cord\\npasses (foramen magnum) is often narrower than\\nnormal, and the opening (spinal canal) through\\nwhich the spinal cord runs in the back bones (ver-\\ntebrae) becomes increasingly and abnormally small\\ndown the length of the spine.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAchondroplasia is caused by a genetic defect. It is\\na dominant trait, meaning that anybody with\\nthe genetic defect will display all the symptoms of\\nthe disorder.

Although\\nachondroplasia can be passed on to subsequent\\noffspring, the majority of cases occur due to a new\\nmutation (change) in a gene. Interestingly enough,\\nthe defect seen in achondroplasia is one of only a\\nfew defects known to increase in frequency with\\nincreasing age of the father (many genetic defects are\\nlinked to increased age of the mother).\\nPeople with achondroplasia have abnormally\\nshort arms and legs. Their trunk is usually of normal\\nsize, as is their head. The appearance of short limbs\\nand normal head size actually makes the head\\nappear to be oversized. The bridge of the nose\\noften has a scooped out appearance termed ‘‘saddle\\nnose.’’ The lower back has an abnormal curvature,\\nor sway back. The face often displays an overly\\nprominent forehead, and a relative lack of develop-\\nment of the face in the area of the upper jaw. Because\\nthe foramen magnum and spinal canal are abnor-\\nmally narrowed, nerve damage may occur if the\\nspinal cord or nerves become compressed. The nar-\\nrowed foramen magnum may disrupt the normal\\nflow of fluid between the brain and the spinal cord,\\nresulting in the accumulation of too much fluid in\\nthe brain (hydrocephalus ). Children with achondro-\\nplasia have a very high risk of serious and repeated\\nmiddle ear infections, which can result in hearing\\nloss.

Like all\\nenzymes, it is needed to trigger specific chemical reac-\\ntions.

One-half to three-\\nfourths of persons who have metastasized prostate\\ncancer have high acid phosphatase levels. Levels fall\\nafter the tumor is removed or reduced through\\ntreatment.\\nTissues other than prostate have small amounts\\nof acid phosphatase, including bone, liver, spleen,\\nkidney, and red blood cells and platelets.

For example, it\\nis important to know if the increased acid phosphatase\\nis from the prostate or red blood cells. Acid phospha-\\ntase from the prostate, called prostatic acid phospha-\\ntase (PAP), is the most medically significant type of\\nacid phosphatase.\\nSubtle differences between prostatic acid phos-\\nphatase and acid phosphatases from other tissues\\ncause them to react differently in the laboratory\\nwhen mixed with certain chemicals. For example,\\nadding the chemical tartrate to the test mixture inhi-\\nbits the activity of prostatic acid phosphatase but not\\nred blood cell acid phosphatase.

It occurs when\\nthe pores of the skin become clogged with oil, dead\\nskin cells, and bacteria.\\nDescription\\nAcne vulgaris, the medical term for common acne,\\nis the most common skin disease. It affects nearly 17\\nmillion people in the United States. While acne can\\narise at any age, it usually begins atpuberty and wor-\\nsens during adolescence. Nearly 85% of people\\ndevelop acne at some time between the ages of 12-25\\nyears. Up to 20% of women develop mild acne. It is\\nalso found in some newborns.\\nThe sebaceous glands lie just beneath the skin’s\\nsurface. They produce an oil called sebum, the skin’s\\nnatural moisturizer. These glands and the hair follicles\\nwithin which they are found are called sebaceous\\nfollicles. These follicles open onto the skin through\\npores. At puberty, increased levels of androgens\\n(male hormones) cause the glands to produce too\\nmuch sebum. When excess sebum combines with\\ndead, sticky skin cells, a hard plug, or comedo, forms\\nthat blocks the pore. Mild noninflammatory acne con-\\nsists of the two types of comedones, whiteheads and\\nblackheads.\\nModerate and severe inflammatory types of acne\\nresult after the plugged follicle is invaded by\\nPropionibacterium acnes, a bacteria that normally\\nlives on the skin. A pimple forms when the damaged\\nfollicle weakens and bursts open, releasing sebum,\\nbacteria, and skin and white blood cells into the sur-\\nrounding tissues. Inflamed pimples near the skin’s sur-\\nface are called papules; when deeper, they are called\\npustules. The most severe type of acne consists of cysts\\n(closed sacs) and nodules (hard swellings). Scarring\\noccurs when new skin cells are laid down to replace\\ndamaged cells.\\nThe most common sites of acne are the face, chest,\\nshoulders, and back since these are the parts of the\\nbody where the most sebaceous follicles are found.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of acne is unknown. Several risk\\nfactors have been identified:\\n/C15Age. Due to the hormonal changes they experience,\\nteenagers are more likely to develop acne.\\n/C15Gender. Boys have more severe acne and develop it\\nmore often than girls.\\n/C15Disease. Hormonal disorders can complicate acne in\\ngirls.\\n/C15Heredity.

Treatment\\nchoice depends upon whether the acne is mild, mod-\\nerate, or severe.\\nDrugs\\nTOPICAL DRUGS. Treatment for mild noninflam-\\nmatory acne consists of reducing the formation of new\\ncomedones with topical tretinoin, benzoyl peroxide,\\nadapalene, or salicylic acid. Tretinoin is especially\\neffective because it increases turnover (death and\\nreplacement) of skin cells. When complicated by\\ninflammation,topical antibioticsmay be added to the\\ntreatment regimen. Improvement is usually seen in\\ntwo to four weeks.\\nTopical medications are available as cream, gel,\\nlotion, or pad preparations of varying strengths.\\nThey includeantibiotics (agents that kill bacteria),\\nsuch as erythromycin, clindamycin (Cleocin-T), and\\nmeclocycline (Meclan); comedolytics (agents that\\nloosen hard plugs and open pores) such as the vitamin\\nA acid tretinoin (Retin-A), salicylic acid, adapalene\\n(Differin), resorcinol, and sulfur. Drugs that act as\\nboth comedolytics and antibiotics, such as benzoyl\\nperoxide, azelaic acid (Azelex), or benzoyl peroxide\\nplus erythromycin (Benzamycin), are also used.\\nThese drugs may be used for months to years to\\nachieve disease control.\\nAfter washing with mild soap, the drugs are\\napplied alone or in combination, once or twice a day\\nover the entire affected area of skin. Possible side\\neffects include mild redness, peeling, irritation, dry-\\nness, and an increased sensitivity to sunlight that\\nrequires use of a sunscreen.\\nORAL DRUGS. Oral antibiotics are taken daily for\\ntwo to four months.The drugs used include tetracycline,\\nerythromycin, minocycline (Minocin), doxycycline,\\nclindamycin (Cleocin), and trimethoprim- sulfamethox-\\nazole (Bactrim, Septra). Possible side effects include\\nallergic reactions, stomach upset, vaginal yeast infec-\\ntions,dizziness, and tooth discoloration.\\nThe goal of treating moderate acne is to decrease\\ninflammation and prevent new comedone formation.\\nOne effective treatment is topical tretinoin along with\\na topical or oral antibiotic. A combination of topical\\nbenzoyl peroxide and erythromycin is also very effec-\\ntive. Improvement is normally seen within four to six\\nweeks, but treatment is maintained for at least two to\\nfour months.\\nA drug reserved for the treatment of severe\\nacne, oral isotretinoin (Accutane), reduces sebum\\nproduction and cell stickiness. It is the treatment\\nof choice for severe acne with cysts and nodules,\\nand is used with or without topical or oral antibio-\\ntics. Taken for four to five months, it provides long-\\nterm disease control in up to 60% of patients. If the\\nacne reappears, another course of isotretinoin may\\nbe needed by about 20% of patients, while another\\n20% may do well with topical drugs or oral anti-\\nbiotics.

The vestib-\\nular and cochlear nerves lie next to one another. They\\nalso run along side other cranial nerves. People possess\\ntwo of each type of vestibulocochlear nerve, one that\\nextends from the left ear and one that extends from the\\nright ear.\\nThe vestibular nerve transmits information con-\\ncerning balance from the inner ear to the brain and the\\ncochlear nerve transmits information about hearing.\\nThe vestibular nerve, like many nerves, is surrounded\\nby a cover called a myelin sheath. A tumor, called\\na schwannoma, can sometimes develop from the cells\\nof the myelin sheath. A tumor is an abnormal growth\\nof tissue that results from the uncontrolled growth of\\ncells. Acoustic neuromas are often called vestibular\\nschwannomas because they are tumors that arise\\n28 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAcoustic neuroma'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 58, 'page_label': '59'}, page_content='from the myelin sheath that surrounds the vestibular\\nnerve. Acoustic neuromas are considered benign\\n(non-cancerous) tumors since they do not spread\\nto other parts of the body. They can occur any-\\nwhere along the vestibular nerve but are most likely\\nto occur where the vestibulocochlear nerve passes\\nthrough the tiny bony canal that connects the brain\\nand the inner ear.\\nAn acoustic neuroma can arise from the left\\nvestibular nerve or the right vestibular nerve. A uni-\\nlateral tumor is a tumor arising from one nerve and\\na bilateral tumor arises from both vestibular nerves.\\nUnilateral acoustic neuromas usually occur sponta-\\nneously (by chance). Bilateral acoustic neuromas\\noccur as part of a hereditary condition called\\nNeurofibromatosisType 2 (NF2). A person with\\nNF2 has inherited a pred isposition for develop-\\ning acoustic neuromas and other tumors of the\\nnerve cells.\\nAcoustic neuromas usu ally grow slowly and\\ncan take years to develop. Some acoustic neuromas\\nremain so small that they do not cause any symp-\\ntoms. As the acoustic neuroma grows it can inter-\\nfere with the functioning of the vestibular nerve\\nand can cause vertigo and balance difficulties. If\\nthe acoustic nerve grows large enough to press\\nagainst the cochlear nerve, then hearing loss and\\na ringing (tinnitus) in the affected ear will usually\\noccur. If untreated and the acoustic neuroma con-\\ntinues to grow it can press against other nerves in\\nthe region and cause other symptoms. This tumor\\ncan be life threatening if it becomes large enough\\nto press against and interfere with the functioning\\nof the brain.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAn acoustic neuroma is caused by a change or\\nabsence of both of the NF2 tumor suppressor genes\\nin a nerve cell. Every person possesses a pair of NF2\\ngenes in every cell of their body including their nerve\\ncells. One NF2 gene is inherited from the egg cell of the\\nmother and one NF2 gene is inherited from the sperm\\ncell of the father. The NF2 gene is responsible for\\nhelping to prevent the formation of tumors in the\\nnerve cells. In particular the NF2 gene helps to prevent\\nacoustic neuromas.\\nOnly one unchanged and functioning NF2 gene\\nis necessary to prevent the formation of an acoustic\\nneuroma. If both NF2 genes become changed or\\nmissing in one of the myelin sheath cells of the\\nvestibular nerve then an acoustic neuroma will usually\\ndevelop. Most unilateral acoustic neuromas result\\nwhen the NF2 genes become spontaneously changed\\nor missing.

NF2 should be\\nconsidered in someone under the age of 40 who has a\\nunilateral acoustic neuroma. Someone with a unilat-\\neral acoustic neuroma and other family members\\ndiagnosed with NF2 probably is affected with NF2.\\nSomeone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma and\\nother symptoms of NF2 such as cataracts and other\\ntumors may also be affected with NF2. On the other\\nhand, someone over the age of 50 with a unilateral\\nacoustic neuroma, no other tumors and no family\\nhistory of NF2 is very unlikely to be affected\\nwith NF2.\\nRecent studies in Europe have suggested a possi-\\nble connection between the widespread use of mobile\\nphones and an increased risk of developing acoustic\\nneuromas. Some observers, however, question\\nwhether mobile phones have been in use long enough\\nto be an identifiable risk factor.\\nSymptoms\\nSmall acoustic neuromas usually only interfere\\nwith the functioning of the vestibulocochlear nerve.\\nThe most common first symptom of an acoustic neu-\\nroma ishearing loss, which is often accompanied by a\\nringing sound (tinnitis). People with acoustic neuro-\\nmas sometimes report difficulties in using the phone\\nand difficulties in perceiving the tone of a musical\\ninstrument or sound even when their hearing appears\\nto be otherwise normal. In most cases the hearing loss\\nis initially subtle and worsens gradually over time\\nuntil deafness occurs in the affected ear. In approxi-\\nmately 10% of cases the hearing loss is sudden and\\nsevere.\\nAcoustic neuromas can also affect the function-\\ning of the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear\\nnerve and van cause vertigo and dysequilibrium.\\nTwenty percent of small tumors are associated with\\nperiodic vertigo, which is characterized bydizziness\\nor a whirling sensation. Larger acoustic neuromas are\\nless likely to cause vertigo but more likely to cause\\ndysequilibrium. Dysequilibrium, which is character-\\nized by minor clumsiness and a general feeling of\\ninstability, occurs in nearly 50% of people with an\\nacoustic neuroma.\\nAs the tumor grows larger it can press on the\\nsurrounding cranial nerves. Compression of the fifth\\ncranial nerve can result in facialpain and or numb-\\nness. Compression of the seventh cranial nerve can\\ncause spasms, weakness or paralysis of the facial\\nmuscles. Double vision is a rare symptom but can\\nresult when the 6th cranial nerve is affected.\\nSwallowing and/or speaking difficulties can occur if\\nthe tumor presses against the 9th, 10th, or 12th cra-\\nnial nerves.\\nIf left untreated, the tumor can become large\\nenough to press against and affect the functioning\\nof the brain stem. The brain stem is the stalk like\\nportion of the brain that joins the spinal cord to the\\ncerebrum, the thinking and reasoning part of the\\nbrain. Different parts of the brainstem have different\\nfunctions such as the control of breathing and muscle\\ncoordination. Large tumors that impact the brain\\nstem can result in headaches, walking difficulties\\n(gait ataxia) and involuntary shaking movements of\\nthe muscles (tremors). In rare cases when an acoustic\\nneuroma remains undiagnosed and untreated it can\\ncause nausea, vomiting, lethargy and eventually\\ncoma, respiratory difficulties and death. In the vast\\nmajority of cases, however, the tumor is discovered\\nand treated long before it is large enough to cause\\nsuch serious manifestations.\\n30 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAcoustic neuroma'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 60, 'page_label': '61'}, page_content='Diagnosis\\nAnyone with symptoms of hearing loss should\\nundergo hearing evaluations. Pure tone and speech\\naudiometryare two screening tests that are often\\nused to evaluate hearing. Pure tone audiometry\\ntests to see how well someone can hear tones of\\ndifferent volume and pitch and speech audiometry\\ntests to see how well someone can hear and recog-\\nnize speech. An acoustic neuroma is suspected in\\nsomeone with unilateral hearing loss or hearing loss\\nthat is less severe in one ear than the other ear\\n(asymmetrical).\\nSometimes an auditory brainstem response (ABR,\\nBAER) test is performed to help establish whether\\nsomeone is likely to have an acoustic neuroma.\\nDuring the ABR examination, a harmless electrical\\nimpulse is passed from the inner ear to the brainstem.\\nAn acoustic neuroma can interfere with the passage of\\nthis electrical impulse and this interference can, some-\\ntimes be identified through the ABR evaluation.\\nA normal ABR examination does not rule out the\\npossibility of an acoustic neuroma. An abnormal\\nABR examination increases the likelihood that an\\nacoustic neuroma is present but other tests are neces-\\nsary to confirm the presence of a tumor.\\nIf an acoustic neuroma is strongly suspected then\\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually per-\\nformed. The MRI is a very accurate evaluation that\\nis able to detect nearly 100% of acoustic neuromas.\\nComputerized tomography (CT scan, CAT scan)is\\nunable to identify smaller tumors; but it can be used\\nwhen an acoustic neuroma is suspected and an MRI\\nevaluation cannot be performed.\\nOnce an acoustic neuroma is diagnosed, an eva-\\nluation by genetic specialists such as a geneticist and\\ngenetic counselor may be recommended. The purpose\\nof this evaluation is to obtain a detailed family history\\nand check for signs of NF2. If NF2 is strongly sus-\\npected then DNA testing may be recommended. DNA\\ntesting involves checking the blood cells obtained from\\na routine blood draw for the common gene changes\\nassociated with NF2.\\nTreatment\\nThe three treatment options for acoustic neuroma\\nare surgery, radiation, and observation. The physician\\nand patient should discuss the pros and cons of\\nthe different options prior to making a decision\\nabout treatment. The patient’s, physical health, age,\\nsymptoms, tumor size, and tumor location should be\\nconsidered.\\nMicrosurgery\\nThe surgical removal of the tumor or tumors is the\\nmost common treatment for acoustic neuroma. In\\nmost cases the entire tumor is removed during the\\nsurgery. If the tumor is large and causing significant\\nsymptoms, yet there is a need to preserve hearing\\nin that ear, then only part of the tumor may be\\nremoved. During the procedure the tumor is removed\\nunder microscopic guidance and general anesthetic.\\nMonitoring of the neighboring cranial nerves is done\\nduring the procedure so that damage to these nerves\\ncan be prevented. If preservation of hearing is a possi-\\nbility, then monitoring of hearing will also take place\\nduring the surgery.\\nMost people stay in the hospital four to seven days\\nfollowing the surgery. Total recovery usually takes\\nfour to six weeks. Most people experiencefatigue and\\nhead discomfort following the surgery. Problems with\\nbalance and head and neck stiffness are also common.\\nThe mortality rate of this type of surgery is less than\\n2% at most major centers. Approximately 20% of\\npatients experience some degree of post-surgical com-\\nplications. In most cases these complications can be\\nmanaged successfully and do not result in long term\\nmedical problems. Surgery brings with it a risk of\\nstroke, damage to the brain stem, infection, leakage\\nof spinal fluid and damage to the cranial nerves.\\nHearing loss and/or tinnitis often result from the sur-\\ngery. A follow-up MRI is recommended one to five\\nyears following the surgery because of possible\\nregrowth of the tumor.\\nStereotactic radiation therapy\\nDuring stereotacticradiation therapy, also called\\nradiosurgery or radiotherapy, many small beams of\\nradiation are aimed directly at the acoustic neuroma.\\nThe radiation is administered in a single large dose,\\nunder local anesthetic and is performed on an out-\\npatient basis. This results in a high dose of radiation\\nto the tumor but little radiation exposure to the\\nsurrounding area. This treatment approach is limited\\nto small or medium tumors. The goal of the surgery is\\nto cause tumor shrinkage or at least limit the growth\\nof the tumor. The long-term efficacy and risks of this\\ntreatment approach are not known; however, as of\\nthe early 2000s, more and more patients diagnosed\\nwith acoustic neuromas are choosing this form of\\ntherapy.

In many\\ncases these symptoms are temporary. Radiation treat-\\nment can also induce the formation of other benign or\\nmalignant schwannomas. This type of treatment may\\ntherefore be contraindicated in the treatment of acous-\\ntic neuromas in those with NF2 who are predisposed\\nto developing schwannomas and other tumors.\\nObservation\\nAcoustic neuromas are usually slow growing and\\nin some cases they will stop growing and even become\\nsmaller or disappear entirely. It may therefore be\\nappropriate in some cases to hold off on treatment\\nand to periodically monitor the tumor through MRI\\nevaluations. Long-term observation may be appropri-\\nate for example in an elderly person with a small\\nacoustic neuroma and few symptoms. Periodic obser-\\nvation may also be indicated for someone with a small\\nand asymptomatic acoustic neuroma that was\\ndetected through an evaluation for another medical\\nproblem. Observation may also be suggested for some-\\none with an acoustic neuroma in the only hearing ear\\nor in the ear that has better hearing. The danger of an\\nobservational approach is that as the tumor grows\\nlarger it can become more difficult to treat.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for someone with a unilateral\\nacoustic neuroma is usually quite good provided the\\ntumor is diagnosed early and appropriate treatment is\\ninstituted. Long term-hearing loss and tinnitis in the\\naffected ear are common, even if appropriate treat-\\nment is provided. Many patients also experience\\nfacial weakness, balance problems, and headaches.\\nRegrowth of the tumor is also a possibility following\\nsurgery or radiation therapy and repeat treatment may\\nbe necessary. The prognosis can be poorer for those\\nwith NF2 who have an increased risk of bilateral\\nacoustic neuromas and other tumors.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBeers, Mark H., MD, and Robert Berkow, MD., editors.\\n‘‘Acoustic Neuroma.’’ Section 7, Chapter 85 InThe\\nMerck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy.

A gland is a collection of cells that releases\\ncertain chemicals, or hormones, which are important\\nto the functioning of other organs or body systems.\\nThe pituitary hormones travel throughout the body\\nand are involved in a large number of activities,\\nincluding the regulation of growth and reproductive\\nfunctions. The cause of acromegaly can be traced to\\nthe pituitary’s production of GH.\\nUnder normal conditions, the pituitary receives\\ninput from another brain structure, the hypothalamus,\\nlocated at the base of the brain. This input from the\\nhypothalamus regulates the pituitary’s release of hor-\\nmones. For example, the hypothalamus produces\\ngrowth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which\\ndirects the pituitary to release GH. Input from the\\nhypothalamus should also direct the pituitary to stop\\nreleasing hormones.\\nIn acromegaly, the pituitary continues to release\\nGH and ignores signals from the hypothalamus. In the\\nliver, GH causes production of a hormone called insu-\\nlin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is responsible\\nfor growth throughout the body. When the pituitary\\nrefuses to stop producing GH, the levels of IGF-1 also\\nreach abnormal peaks. Bones, soft tissue, and organs\\nthroughout the body begin to enlarge, and the body\\nchanges its ability to process and use nutrients like\\nsugars and fats.\\nIn acromegaly, an individual’s hands and feet begin\\nto grow, becoming thick and doughy. The jaw line, nose,\\nand forehead also grow, and facial features are described\\nas ‘‘coarsening’’. The tongue grows larger, and because\\nthe jaw is larger, the teeth become more widely spaced.\\nDue to swelling within the structures of the throat\\nand sinuses, the voice becomes deeper and sounds\\nmore hollow, and patients may develop loudsnoring.\\nVarious hormonal changes cause symptoms such as:\\n/C15heavy sweating\\n/C15oily skin\\n/C15increased coarse body hair\\n/C15improper processing of sugars in the diet (and some-\\ntimes actual diabetes)\\nKEY TERMS\\nAdenoma— A type of noncancerous (benign) tumor\\nthat often involves the overgrowth of certain cells\\nfound in glands.\\nGland— A collection of cells that releases certain\\nchemicals, or hormones, that are important to the\\nfunctioning of other organs or body systems.\\nHormone— A chemical produced in one part of the\\nbody that travels to another part of the body in order\\nto exert an effect.\\nHypothalamus— A structure within the brain\\nresponsible for a large number of normal functions\\nthroughout the body, including regulating sleep,\\ntemperature, eating, and sexual development.

This increase in\\nskin tags is also associated with the development of\\ngrowths, called polyps, within the large intestine that\\nmay eventually become cancerous. Patients with acro-\\nmegaly often suffer from headaches and arthritis. The\\nvarious swellings and enlargements throughout the\\nbody may press on nerves, causing sensations of local\\ntinglingor burning, and sometimes result in muscle\\nweakness.\\nThe most common cause of this disorder (in 90%\\nof patients) is the development of a noncancerous\\ntumor within the pituitary, called a pituitary adenoma.\\nThese tumors are the source of the abnormal release of\\nGH. As these tumors grow, they may press on nearby\\nstructures within the brain, causing headaches and\\nchanges in vision. As the adenoma grows, it may dis-\\nrupt other pituitary tissue, interfering with the release\\nof other hormones. These disruptions may be respon-\\nsible for changes in the menstrual cycle of women,\\ndecreases in the sexual drive in men and women, and\\nthe abnormal production of breast milk in women.\\nIn rare cases, acromegaly is caused by the abnormal\\nproduction of GHRH, which leads to the increased\\nproduction of GH. Certain tumors in the pancreas,\\nlungs, adrenal glands, thyroid, and intestine produce\\nGHRH, which in turn triggers production of an\\nabnormal quantity of GH.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause acromegaly produces slow changes over\\ntime, diagnosis is often significantly delayed. In fact,\\nthe characteristic coarsening of the facial features is\\noften not recognized by family members, friends, or\\nlong-time family physicians. Often, the diagnosis is\\nsuspected by a new physician who sees the patient for\\nthe first time and is struck by the patient’s character-\\nistic facial appearance. Comparing old photographs\\nfrom a number of different time periods will often\\nincrease suspicion of the disease.\\nBecause the quantity of GH produced varies\\nwidely under normal conditions, demonstrating high\\nlevels of GH in the blood is not sufficient to merit a\\ndiagnosis of acromegaly. Instead, laboratory tests mea-\\nsuring an increase of IGF-1 (3-10 times above the\\nnormal level) are useful. These results, however, must\\nbe carefully interpreted because normal laboratory\\nvalues for IGF-1 vary when the patient is pregnant,\\nundergoing puberty, elderly, or severely malnourished.\\nNormal patients will show a decrease in GH produc-\\ntion when given a large dose of sugar (glucose). Patients\\nwith acromegaly will not show this decrease, and will\\noften show an increase in GH production. Magnetic\\nresonance imaging (MRI) is useful for viewing the\\npituitary, and for identifying and locating an adenoma.\\nWhen no adenoma can be located, the search for a\\nGHRH-producing tumor in another location begins.\\nTreatment\\nThe first step in treatment of acromegaly is\\nremoval of all or part of the pituitary adenoma.\\nRemoval requires surgery, usually performed by\\nentering the skull through the nose. While this surgery\\ncan cause rapid improvement of many acromegaly\\nsymptoms, most patients will also require additional\\ntreatment with medication. Bromocriptine (Parlodel)\\nis a medication that can be taken by mouth, while\\noctreotide (Sandostatin) must be injected every eight\\nhours. Both of these medications are helpful in redu-\\ncing GH production, but must often be taken for life\\nand produce their own unique side effects. Some\\npatients who cannot undergo surgery are treated\\nwith radiation therapy to the pituitary in an attempt\\nto shrink the adenoma. Radiating the pituitary may\\ntake up to 10 years, however, and may also injure/\\ndestroy other normal parts of the pituitary.\\nPrognosis\\nWithout treatment, patients with acromegaly will\\nmost likely die early because of the disease’s effects on\\nA comparison of the right hand of a person afflicted\\nwith acromegaly (left) and the hand of a normal sized person.\\n(Custom Medical Stock Photo.

Infection most\\noften occurs in the face and neck region and is char-\\nacterized by the presence of a slowly enlarging, hard,\\nred lump.\\nDescription\\nActinomycosis is a relatively rare infection\\noccurring in one out of 300,000(1/300,000) people\\nper year. It is characterized by the presence of a\\nlump or mass that often forms, draining sinus tracts\\nto the skin surface. Fiftypercent of actinomycosis\\ncases are of the head and neck region (also called\\n‘‘lumpy jaw’’ and ‘‘cervicofacial actinomycosis’’),\\n15% are in the chest, 20% are in the abdomen, and\\nthe rest are in the pelvis, heart, and brain. Men are\\nthree times more likely to develop actinomycosis than\\nwomen.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nActinomycosis is usually caused by the bacterium\\nActinomyces israelii . This bacterium is normally pre-\\nsent in the mouth but can cause disease if it enters\\ntissues following an injury.Actinomyces israelii is an\\nanaerobic bacterium which means it dislikes oxygen\\nbut grows very well in deep tissues where oxygen levels\\nare low. Tooth extraction, tooth disease, root canal\\ntreatment, jaw surgery, or poor dental hygiene can\\nallow Actinomyces israelii to cause an infection in the\\nhead and neck region.\\nThe main symptom of cervicofacial actinomycosis\\nis the presence of a hard lump on the face or neck. The\\nlump may or may not be red.Fever occurs in some\\ncases.\\nDiagnosis\\nCervicofacial actinomycosis can be diagnosed by\\na family doctor or dentist and the patient may be\\nreferred to an oral surgeon or infectious disease\\nspecialist. The diagnosis of actinomycosis is based\\nupon several things. The presence of a red lump with\\ndraining sinuses on the head or neck is strongly\\nsuggestive of cervicofacial actinomycosis. A recent\\nhistory of tooth extraction or signs oftooth decayor\\npoor dental hygiene aid in the diagnosis. Microscopic\\nexamination of the fluid draining from the sinuses\\nshows the characteristic ‘‘sulfur Granules’’ (small\\nyellow colored material in the fluid) produced by\\nActinomyces israelii . A biopsy may be performed to\\nremove a sample of the infected tissue. This procedure\\ncan be performed underlocal anesthesiain the doctor’s\\noffice. Occasionally the bacteria can be cultured\\nfrom the sinus tract fluid or from samples of the\\ninfected tissue.\\nActinomycosis in the lungs, abdomen, pelvis, or\\nbrain can be very hard to diagnose since the symptoms\\noften mimic those of other diseases.

Instead, wide-awake patients were being oper-\\nated on, with only acupuncture needles inserted into\\nthem to control pain. At that time, a famous columnist\\nfor theNew York Times , James Reston, had to\\nundergo surgery and elected to use acupuncture for\\nanesthesia.

A Chinese medicine practitioner examines a\\npatient very thoroughly, looking at physical, mental\\nand emotional activity, taking the pulse usually at the\\nwrists, examining the tongue and complexion, and\\nobserving the patient’s demeanor and attitude, to get\\na complete diagnosis of which organs and meridian\\npoints are out of balance. When the imbalance is\\nlocated, the physician will recommend specific pres-\\nsure points for acupuncture or acupressure.

In a massage therapy treatment, a\\nperson usually lies down on a table or mat, with thin\\nclothing on. The acupressurist will gently feel and\\npalpate the abdomen and other parts of the body to\\ndetermine energy imbalances. Then, the therapist will\\nwork with different meridians throughout the body,\\ndepending on which organs are imbalanced in the\\nabdomen. The therapist will use different types of\\nfinger movements and pressure on different acupoints,\\ndepending on whether the chi needs to be increased\\nor dispersed at different points. The therapist observes\\nand guides the energy flow through the patient’s body\\nthroughout the session. Sometimes, special herbs\\n(Artemesia vulgaris or moxa) may be placed on a\\npoint to warm it, a process calledmoxibustion. A ses-\\nsion of acupressure is generally a very pleasant experi-\\nence, and some people experience great benefit\\nimmediately. For more chronic conditions, several\\nsessions may be necessary to relieve and improve\\nconditions.\\nAcupressure massage usually costs from $30–70\\nper hour session.

On Nixon’s trip, journalists were amazed\\nto observe major operations being performed on\\npatients without the use of anesthetics. Instead,\\nwide-awake patients were being operated on with\\nonly acupuncture needles inserted into them to con-\\ntrol pain. During that time, a famous columnist for\\ntheNew York Times , James Reston, had to undergo\\nsurgery and elected to use acupuncture instead of\\npain medication, and he wrote some convincing\\nstories on its effectiveness.\\nToday, acupuncture is being practiced in all 50\\nstates by over 9,000 practitioners, with over 4,000\\nMDs including it in their practices.

To\\nunderstand the ideas behind acupuncture, it is worth-\\nwhile to introduce some of these basic terms.\\nYIN AND YANG. According to Chinese philosophy,\\nthe universe and the body can be described by two\\nseparate but complementary principles, that of yin\\nand yang. For example, in temperature, yin is cold\\nand yang is hot. In gender, yin is female and yang is\\nmale. In activity, yin is passive and yang is active. In\\nlight, yin is dark and yang is bright; in direction yin is\\ninward and downward and yang is outward and up,\\nand so on. Nothing is ever completely yin or yang, but\\na combination of the two. These two principles are\\nalways interacting, opposing, and influencing each\\nother. The goal of Chinese medicine is not to eliminate\\neither yin or yang, but to allow the two to balance each\\nother and exist harmoniously together. For instance, if\\na person suffers from symptoms of high blood pressure,\\nthe Chinese system would say that the heart organ\\nmight have too much yang, and would recommend\\nmethods either to reduce the yang or to increase the\\nyin of the heart, depending on the other symptoms and\\norgans in the body. Thus, acupuncture therapies seek to\\neither increase or reduce yang, or increase or reduce yin\\nin particular regions of the body.\\nCHI. Another fundamental concept of Chinese\\nmedicine is that of chi (pronouncedchee, also spelled\\nqi). Chi is the fundamental life energy of the universe.\\nIt is invisible and is found in the environment in the\\nair, water, food and sunlight. In the body, it is the\\ninvisible vital force that creates and animates life.\\nWe are all born with inherited amounts of chi, and\\nwe also get acquired chi from the food we eat and the\\nair we breathe. The level and quality of a person’s chi\\nalso depends on the state of physical, mental and\\nemotional balance. Chi travels through the body\\nalong channels calledmeridians.\\nTHE ORGAN SYSTEM. In the Chinese system, there\\nare twelve main organs: the lung, large intestine, sto-\\nmach, spleen, heart, small intestine, urinary bladder,\\nkidney, liver, gallbladder, pericardium, and the ‘‘triple\\nwarmer,’’ which represents the entire torso region.\\nEach organ has chi energy associated with it, and\\neach organ interacts with particular emotions on the\\nmental level. As there are twelve organs, there are\\ntwelve types of chi which can move through the body,\\nand these move through twelve main channels or mer-\\nidians. Chinese doctors connect symptoms to organs.\\nThat is, symptoms are caused by yin/yang imbalances\\nin one or more organs, or by an unhealthy flow of chi\\nto or from one organ to another. Each organ has a\\ndifferent profile of symptoms it can manifest.\\nTHE FIVE ELEMENTS. Another basis of Chinese the-\\nory is that the world and body are made up of five\\nmain elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.\\nThese elements are all interconnected, and each ele-\\nment either generates or controls another element. For\\ninstance, water controls fire and earth generates metal.\\nEach organ is associated with one of the five elements.\\nThe Chinese system uses elements and organs to\\ndescribe and treat conditions. For instance, the kidney\\nis associated with water and the heart is associated\\nwith fire, and the two organs are related as water and\\nfire are related. If the kidney is weak, then there might\\nbe a corresponding fire problem in the heart, so treat-\\nment might be made by acupuncture or herbs to cool\\nthe heart system and/or increase energy in the kidney\\nsystem.\\nThe Chinese have developed an intricate system of\\nhow organs and elements are related to physical and\\nmental symptoms, and the above example is a very\\nsimple one. Although this system sounds suspect to\\nWestern scientists, some interesting parallels have\\nbeen observed. For instance, Western medicine has\\nobserved that with severe heart problems, kidney fail-\\nure often follows, but it still does not know exactly\\nwhy. In Chinese medicine, this connection between the\\ntwo organs has long been established.\\nMEDICAL PROBLEMS AND ACUPUNCTURE. In\\nChinese medicine, disease as seen as imbalances in\\nthe organ system or chi meridians, and the goal of\\nany remedy or treatment is to assist the body in rees-\\ntablishing its innate harmony. Disease can be caused\\nby internal factors like emotions, external factors like\\nthe environment and weather, and other factors like\\ninjuries, trauma, diet, and germs. However, infection\\nis seen not as primarily a problem with germs and\\nviruses, but as a weakness in the energy of the body\\nwhich is allowing a sickness to occur. In Chinese med-\\nicine, no two illnesses are ever the same, as each body\\nhas its own characteristics of symptoms and balance.\\nAcupuncture is used to open or adjust the flow of chi\\nthroughout the organ system, which will strengthen\\nthe body and prompt it to heal itself.\\nA VISIT TO THE ACUPUNCTURIST. The first thing\\nan acupuncturist will do is get a thorough idea of a\\npatient’s medical history and symptoms, both physi-\\ncal and emotional. This is done with a long question-\\nnaire and interview. Then the acupuncturist will\\nexamine the patient to find further symptoms, look-\\ning closely at the tongue, the pulse at various points\\nin the body, the complexion, general behavior,\\nand other signs like coughs or pains. From this, the\\npractitioner will be able to determine patterns of\\n44 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAcupuncture'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 74, 'page_label': '75'}, page_content='symptoms which indicate which organs and areas\\nare imbalanced. Depending on the problem, the acu-\\npuncturist will insert needles to manipulate chi on\\none or more of the twelve organ meridians. On these\\ntwelve meridians, there are nearly 2,000 points which\\ncan be used in acupuncture, with around 200 points\\nbeing most frequently used by traditional acupunc-\\nturists. During an individual treatment, one to\\ntwenty needles may be used, depending on which\\nmeridian points are chosen.\\nAcupuncture needles are always sterilized and\\nacupuncture is a very safe procedure. The depth of\\ninsertion of needles varies, depending on which chi\\nchannels are being treated. Some points barely go\\nbeyond superficial layers of skin, while some acupunc-\\nture points require a depth of 1-3 in (2.5-7.5 cm) of\\nneedle. The needles generally do not cause pain.\\nPatients sometimes report pinching sensations and\\noften pleasant sensations, as the body experiences\\nhealing. Depending on the problem, the acupuncturist\\nmight spin or move the needles, or even pass a slight\\nelectrical current through some of them.Moxibustion\\nmay be sometimes used, in which an herbal mixture\\n(moxa or mugwort) is either burned like incense on the\\nacupuncture point or on the end of the needle, which\\nis believed to stimulate chi in a particular way. Also,\\nacupuncturists sometimes usecupping, during which\\nsmall suction cups are placed on meridian points to\\nstimulate them.\\nHow long the needles are inserted also varies.\\nSome patients only require a quick in and out inser-\\ntion to clear problems and providetonification\\n(strengthening of health), while some other condi-\\ntions might require needles inserted up to an hour or\\nmore. The average visit to an acupuncturist takes\\nabout thirty minutes. The number of visits to the\\nacupuncturist varies as well, with some conditions\\nimproved in one or two sessions and others requiring\\na series of six or more visits over the course of weeks\\nor months.\\nCosts for acupuncture can vary, depending\\non whether the practitioner is an MD. Initial visits\\nwith non-MD acupuncturists can run from $50-\\n$100, with follow-up visits usually costing less.\\nInsurance reimbursement also varies widely, depend-\\ning on the company and state. Regulations have been\\nchanging often. Some states authorize Medicaid to\\ncover acupuncture for certain conditions, and some\\nstates have mandated that general coverage pay\\nfor acupuncture. Consumers should be aware of\\nthe provisions for acupuncture in their individual\\npolicies.\\nPrecautions\\nAcupuncture is generally a very safe procedure. If\\na patient is in doubt about a medical condition, more\\nthan one physician should be consulted. Also, a\\npatient should always feel comfortable and confident\\nthat their acupuncturist is knowledgable and properly\\ntrained.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nMainstream medicine has been slow to accept\\nacupuncture; although more MDs are using it, the\\nAmerican Medical Association does not recognize\\nit as a specialty. The reason for this is that the\\nmechanism of acupuncture is difficult to scientifi-\\ncally understand or measure, such as the invisible\\nenergy of chi in the body.

Temporarily, the\\nkidneys cannot adequately remove fluids and wastes\\nfrom the body or maintain the proper level of certain\\nkidney-regulated chemicals in the bloodstream.\\nDescription\\nThe kidneys are the body’s natural filtration\\nsystem. They perform the critical task of proces-\\nsing approximately 200 quarts of fluid in the\\nbloodstream every 24 hours. Waste products like\\nurea and toxins, along with excess fluids, are\\nremoved from the bloodstream in the form of\\nurine. Kidney (or renal) failure occurs when kidney\\nfunctioning becomes impaired. Fluids and toxins\\nbegin to accumulate in the bloodstream. As fluids\\nbuild up in the bloodstream, the patient with acute\\nkidney failure may become puffy and swollen (ede-\\nmatous) in the face, hands, and feet. Their blood\\npressure typically begins to rise, and they may\\nexperiencefatigue and nausea.\\nUnlike chronic kidney failure , which is long\\nterm and irreversible, acute kidney failure is a\\ntemporary condition. With proper and timely treat-\\nment, it can typically be reversed. Often there is no\\npermanent damage to the kidneys. Acute kidney\\nfailure appears most frequently as a complication\\nof serious illness, like heart failure, liver failure,\\ndehydration, severe burns, and excessive bleeding\\n(hemorrhage). It may also be caused by an\\nobstruction to the urinary tract or as a direct result\\nof kidney disease, injury, or an adverse reaction to\\nam e d i c i n e .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute kidney failure can be caused by many differ-\\nent illnesses, injuries, and infections. These conditions\\nfall into three main categories:prerenal, postrenal,a n d\\nintrarenal conditions.\\nPrerenal conditions do not damage the kidney,\\nbut can cause diminished kidney function.

Urea in the gastric juices may cause upset\\nstomach.\\nDiagnosis\\nKidney failure is diagnosed by a doctor. A\\nnephrologist, a doctor that specializes in the kid-\\nney, may be consulted to confirm the diagnosis and\\nrecommend treatment options. The patient that is\\nsuspected of having acute kidney failure will have\\nblood and urine tests to determine the level of\\nkidney function. A blood test will assess the levels\\nof creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric\\nacid, phosphate, sodium, and potassium. The kid-\\nney regulates these agents in the blood. Urine sam-\\nples will also be collected, usually over a 24-hour\\nperiod, to assess protein loss and/or creatinine\\nclearance.\\nDetermining the cause of kidney failure is critical\\nto proper treatment. A fullassessment of the kidneys\\nis necessary to determine if the underlying disease\\nis treatable and if the kidney failure is chronic or\\nacute. X rays,magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),\\ncomputed tomography scan (CT), ultrasound, renal\\nbiopsy, and/or arteriogram of the kidneys may be\\nused to determine the cause of kidney failure and\\nlevel of remaining kidney function. X rays and ultra-\\nsound of the bladder and/or ureters may also be\\nneeded.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for acute kidney failure varies.\\nTreatment is directed to the underlying, primary med-\\nical condition that has triggered kidney failure.\\nPrerenal conditions may be treated with replacement\\nfluids given through a vein,diuretics, blood transfusion,\\nor medications. Postrenal conditions and intrarenal\\nconditions may require surgery and/or medication.\\nFrequently, patients in acute kidney failure\\nrequire hemodialysis , hemofiltration ,o r peritoneal\\ndialysis to filter fluids and wastes from the blood-\\nstream until the primary medical condition can be\\ncontrolled.\\nHemodialysis\\nHemodialysis involves circulating the patient’s\\nblood outside of the body through an extracorporeal\\ncircuit (ECC), or dialysis circuit. The ECC is made up\\nof plastic blood tubing, a filter known as a dialyzer (or\\nartificial kidney), and a dialysis machine that monitors\\nand maintains blood flow and administers dialysate.\\nDialysate is a sterile chemical solution that is used to\\ndraw waste products out of the blood. The patient’s\\nblood leaves the body through the vein and travels\\nthrough the ECC and the dialyzer, where fluid\\nremoval takes place.\\nDuring dialysis, waste products in the blood-\\nstream are carried out of the body. At the same time,\\nelectrolytes and other chemicals are added to the\\nblood.

These patients are\\ntypically very sick and may have heart problems or\\ncirculatory problems. They cannot handle the rapid\\nfiltration rates of hemodialysis. They also frequently\\nneedantibiotics, nutrition, vasopressors, and other\\nfluids given through a vein to treat their primary\\ncondition. Because hemofiltration is continuous,\\nprescription fluids can be given to patients in kidney\\nfailure without the risk of fluid overload.\\nLike hemodialysis, hemofiltration uses an ECC.\\nA hollow fiber hemofilter is used instead of a dialyzer\\nto remove fluids and toxins. Instead of a dialysis\\nmachine, a blood pump makes the blood flow through\\nthe ECC. The volume of blood circulating through\\nthe ECC in hemofiltration is less than that in hemo-\\ndialysis. Filtration rates are slower and gentler on the\\ncirculatory system. Hemofiltration treatment will\\ngenerally be used until kidney failure is reversed.\\nPeritoneal dialysis\\nPeritoneal dialysis may be used if an acute kidney\\nfailure patient is stable and not in immediate crisis.\\nIn peritoneal dialysis (PD), the lining of the patient’s\\nabdomen, the peritoneum, acts as a blood filter.\\nA flexible tube-like instrument (catheter) is surgically\\ninserted into the patient’s abdomen. During treat-\\nment, the catheter is used to fill the abdominal cavity\\nwith dialysate. Waste products and excess fluids move\\nfrom the patient’s bloodstream into the dialysate\\nsolution. After a certain time period, the waste-filled\\ndialysate is drained from the abdomen, and replaced\\nwith clean dialysate. There are three type of peritoneal\\ndialysis, which vary according to treatment time and\\nadministration method.\\nPeritoneal dialysis is often the best treatment\\noption for infants and children. Their small size can\\nmake vein access difficult to maintain. It is not recom-\\nmended for patients with abdominal adhesions or\\nother abdominal defects (like a hernia) that might\\nreduce the efficiency of the treatment. It is also not\\nrecommended for patients who suffer frequent bouts\\nof an inflammation of the small pouches in the intest-\\ninal tract (diverticulitis).\\nPrognosis\\nBecause many of the illnesses and underlying\\nconditions that often trigger acute kidney failure\\nare critical, the prognosis for these patients many\\ntimes is not good. Studies have estimated overall\\ndeathrates for acute kidney failure at 42-88%.\\nMany people, however, die because of the primary\\ndisease that has caused the kidney failure. These\\nfigures may also be misleading because patients\\nwho experience kidney failure as a result of less\\nserious illnesses (like kidney stones or dehydration)\\nhave an excellent chance of complete recovery.\\nEarly recognition and prompt, appropriate treat-\\nment are key to patient recovery.\\nUp to 10% of patients who experience acute\\nkidney failure will suffer irreversible kidney damage.\\nThey will eventually go on to develop chronic kidney\\nfailure or end-stage renal disease. These patients will\\nrequire long-term dialysis or kidney transplantation to\\nreplace their lost renal functioning.\\nPrevention\\nSince acute kidney failure can be caused by many\\nthings, prevention is difficult. Medications that may\\nimpair kidney function should be given cautiously.\\nPatients with pre-existing kidney conditions who are\\nhospitalized for other illnesses or injuries should be\\ncarefully monitored for kidney failure complications.\\nTreatments and procedures that may put them at risk\\nfor kidney failure (like diagnostic tests requiring radio-\\ncontrast agents or dyes) should be used with extreme\\ncaution.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nStark, June. ‘‘Dialysis Choices: Turning the Tide in Acute\\nRenal Failure.’’Nursing 27, no. 2 (February 1997):\\n41-8.\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nNational Kidney Foundation. 30 East 33rd St., New York,\\nNY 10016.

Waste\\nmaterials from nearly every organ in the body drain\\ninto the lymphatic vessels and are filtered in small\\norgans called lymph nodes. Foreign bodies, such as\\nbacteria or viruses, are processed in the lymph nodes\\nto generate an immune response to fight an infection.\\nIn acute lymphangitis, bacteria enter the body\\nthrough a cut, scratch, insect bite, surgical wound, or\\nother skin injury. Once the bacteria enter the lympha-\\ntic system, they multiply rapidly and follow the lym-\\nphatic vessel like a highway. The infected lymphatic\\nvessel becomes inflamed, causing red streaks that are\\nvisible below the skin surface. The growth of the bac-\\nteria occurs so rapidly that the immune system does\\nnot respond fast enough to stop the infection.\\nIf left untreated, the bacteria can cause tissue\\ndestruction in the area of the infection. A pus-filled,\\npainful lump called anabscess may be formed in the\\ninfected area. Cellulitis, a generalized infection of\\nthe lower skin layers, may also occur. In addition,\\nthe bacteria may invade the bloodstream and cause\\nsepticemia. Lay people, for that reason, often call\\nthe red streaks seen in the skin ‘‘blood poisoning.’’\\nSepticemia is a very serious illness and may be fatal.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute lymphangitis is most often caused by the\\nbacterium Streptococcus pyogenes . This potentially\\ndangerous bacterium also causes strep throat, infec-\\ntions of the heart, spinal cord, and lungs, and in the\\n1990s has been called the ‘‘flesh-eating bacterium.’’\\nStaphylococci bacteria may also cause lymphangitis.\\nAlthough anyone can develop lymphangitis, some\\npeople are more at risk. People who have had radical\\nmastectomy(removal of a breast and nearby lymph\\nnodes), a leg vein removed for coronary bypass sur-\\ngery, or recurrent lymphangitis caused by tinea pedis\\n(a fungal infection on the foot) are at an increased risk\\nfor lymphangitis.\\nThe characteristic symptoms of acute lymphangi-\\ntis are the wide, red streaks which travel from the site\\nof infection to the armpit or groin. The affected areas\\nare red, swollen, and painful. Blistering of the affected\\nskin may occur. The bacterial infection causes afever\\nof 100-1048F (38-408C). In addition, a general ill\\nfeeling, muscle aches, headache, chills, and loss of\\nappetite may be felt.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf lymphangitis is suspected, the person should\\ncall his or her doctor immediately or go to an emer-\\ngency room. Acute lymphangitis could be diagnosed\\nby the family doctor, infectious disease specialist,\\nor an emergency room doctor. The painful, red\\nstreaks just below the skin surface and the high\\nfever are diagnostic of acute lymphangitis. A sample\\nof blood would be taken for culture to determine\\nwhether the bacteria have entered the bloodstream.\\nA biopsy (removal of a piece of infected tissue)\\nsample may be taken for culture to identify which\\ntype of bacteria is causing the infection. Diagnosis is\\nimmediate because it is based primarily on the symp-\\ntoms. Most insurance policies should cover the\\nexpenses for the diagnosis and treatment of acute\\nlymphangitis.\\nTreatment\\nBecause of the serious nature of this infection, treat-\\nment would begin immediately even before the bacterial\\nculture results were available. The only treatment for\\nacute lymphangitis is to give very large doses of an\\nantibiotic, usually penicillin, through the vein. Grow-\\ning streptococcal bacteria are usually eliminated rapidly\\nand easily by penicillin. The antibiotic clindamycin may\\nbe included in the treatment to kill any streptococci\\nwhich are not growing and are in a resting state.\\nKEY TERMS\\nBiopsy— The process which removes a sample of\\ndiseased or infected tissue for microscopic exam-\\nination to aid in diagnosis.\\nLymphatic system— A component of the immune\\nsystem consisting of vessels and nodes.

Examples are\\nrape, mugging, combat, natural disasters, etc.\\nThe symptoms of stress disorder include a com-\\nbining of one or more dissociative and anxiety symp-\\ntoms with the avoidance of reminders of the traumatic\\nevent.

The term has been par-\\ntially replaced by the worddependence for substance\\nabuse. Addiction has been extended, however, to\\ninclude mood-altering behaviors or activities. Some\\nresearchers speak of two types of addictions: sub-\\nstance addictions (for example,alcoholism, drug\\nabuse,a n dsmoking); and process addictions (for\\nexample, gambling, spending, shopping, eating, and\\nsexual activity). There is a growing recognition that\\nmany addicts, such as polydrug abusers, are addicted\\nto more than one substance or process.\\nDescription\\nAddiction is one of the most costly public\\nhealth problems in the United States. It is a pro-\\ngressive syndrome, which means that it increases in\\nseverity over time unless i t is treated. Substance\\nabuse is characterized by frequent relapse, or return\\nto the abused substance.Substance abusers often\\nmake repeated attempts to quit before they are\\nsuccessful.\\nThe economic cost of substance abuse in the\\nUnited States exceeds $414 billion, with health care\\ncosts attributed to substance abuse estimated at more\\nthan $114 billion.\\nBy eighth grade, 52% of adolescents have con-\\nsumed alcohol, 41% have smoked tobacco, and 20%\\nhave smokedmarijuana. Compared to females, males\\nare almost four times as likely to be heavy drinkers,\\nnearly one and a half more likely to smoke a pack or\\nmore of cigarettes daily, and twice as likely to smoke\\nmarijuana weekly. However, among adolescents\\nthese gender differences are not as pronounced and\\ngirls are almost as likely to abuse substances such\\nas alcohol and cigarettes.

Odle\\nAddison’s disease\\nDefinition\\nAddison’s disease is a disorder involving dis-\\nrupted functioning of the part of the adrenal gland\\ncalled the cortex. This results in decreased production\\nof two important chemicals (hormones) normally\\nreleased by the adrenal cortex: cortisol and\\naldosterone.\\nDescription\\nThe adrenals are two glands, each perched on the\\nupper part of the two kidneys. The outer part of the\\ngland is known as the cortex; the inner part is known\\nas the medulla. Each of these parts of the adrenal\\ngland is responsible for producing different types of\\nhormones.\\nCortisol is a very potent hormone produced by the\\nadrenal cortex. It is involved in regulating the func-\\ntioning of nearly every type of organ and tissue\\nthroughout the body, and is considered to be one of\\nthe few hormones absolutely necessary for life.\\nCortisol is involved in:\\n/C15the very complex processing and utilization of many\\nnutrients, including sugars (carbohydrates), fats, and\\nproteins\\n/C15the normal functioning of the circulatory system and\\nthe heart\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 55\\nAddison’s disease'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 85, 'page_label': '86'}, page_content='/C15the functioning of muscles\\n/C15normal kidney function\\n/C15production of blood cells\\n/C15the normal processes involved in maintaining the\\nskeletal system\\n/C15proper functioning of the brain and nerves\\n/C15the normal responses of the immune system\\nAldosterone, also produced by the adrenal cortex,\\nplays a central role in maintaining the appropriate\\nproportions of water and salts in the body. When\\nthis balance is upset, the volume of blood circulating\\nthroughout the body will fall dangerously low, accom-\\npanied by a drop in blood pressure.\\nAddison’s disease is also called primary adreno-\\ncortical insufficiency. In other words, some process\\ninterferes directly with the ability of the adrenal cortex\\nto produce its hormones. Levels of both cortisol and\\naldosterone drop, and numerous functions through-\\nout the body are disrupted.\\nAddison’s disease occurs in about four in every\\n100,000 people. It strikes both men and women of all\\nages.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of Addison’s disease is\\nthe destruction and/or shrinking (atrophy) of the adre-\\nnal cortex. In about 70% of all cases, this atrophy is\\nbelieved to occur due to an autoimmune disorder. In an\\nautoimmune disorder, the immune system of the body,\\nresponsible for identifying foreign invaders such as\\nviruses or bacteria and killing them, accidentally begins\\nto identify the cells of the adrenal cortex as foreign,\\nand destroy them. In about 20% of all cases, destruc-\\ntion of the adrenal cortex is caused bytuberculosis.T h e\\nremaining cases of Addison’s disease may be caused\\nby fungal infections, such ashistoplasmosis, coccidio-\\nmycosis, andcryptococcosis, which affect the adrenal\\ngland by producing destructive, tumor-like masses\\ncalled granulomas; a disease calledamyloidosis,i n\\nwhich a starchy substance called amyloid is deposited\\nin abnormal places throughout the body, interfering\\nwith the function of whatever structure it is present\\nwithin; or invasion of the adrenal glands bycancer.\\nIn about 75% of all patients, Addison’s disease\\ntends to be a very gradual, slowly developing disease.\\nSignificant symptoms are not noted until about\\n90% of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed. The\\nmost common symptoms includefatigue and loss\\nof energy, decreased appetite,nausea, vomiting, diar-\\nrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, muscle weakness,\\ndizziness when standing,dehydration, unusual areas of\\ndarkened (pigmented) skin, and dark freckling. As the\\ndisease progresses, the patient may appear to have\\nvery tanned, or bronzed skin, with darkening of the\\nlining of the mouth, vagina, and rectum, and dark\\npigmentation of the area around the nipples (aere-\\nola).

Once suspected, a number\\nof blood tests can lead to the diagnosis of Addison’s\\ndisease. It is not sufficient to demonstrate low blood\\ncortisol levels, as normal levels of cortisol vary quite\\nwidely. Instead, patients are given a testing dose of\\nanother hormone called corticotropin (ACTH).\\nACTH is produced in the body by the pituitary\\ngland, and normally acts by promoting growth\\nwithin the adrenal cortex and stimulating the produc-\\ntion and release of cortisol.

Together these four arsenals\\nof immune defense guard the major entrance to the\\nbody from foreign invaders–the germs we breathe and\\neat. In contrast to the rest of the body’s tissues, lym-\\nphoid tissue reaches its greatest size in mid-childhood\\nand recedes thereafter. In this way children are best\\nable to develop the immunities they need to survive in\\na world full of infectious diseases.\\nBeyond its normal growth pattern, lymphoid tis-\\nsue grows excessively (hypertrophies) during an acute\\ninfection, as it suddenly increases its immune activity\\nto fight off the invaders. Often it does not completely\\nreturn to its former size. Each subsequent infection\\nleaves behind a larger set of tonsils and adenoids. To\\nmake matters worse, the sponge-like structure of these\\nhypertrophied glands can produce safe havens for\\ngerms where the body cannot reach and eliminate\\nthem. Beforeantibiotics and the reduction in infectious\\nchildhood diseases over the past few generations, ton-\\nsils and adenoids caused greater health problems.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMost tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy is simply\\ncaused by the normal growth pattern for that type of\\ntissue. Less often, the hypertrophy is due to repeated\\nthroat infections by cold viruses, strep throat, mono-\\nnucleosis, and in times gone by,diphtheria. The acute\\ninfections are usually referred to astonsillitis, the ade-\\nnoids getting little recognition because they cannot be\\nseen without special instruments. Symptoms include\\npainful, bright red, often ulcerated tonsils, enlarge-\\nment of lymph nodes (glands) beneath the jaw,fever,\\nand general discomfort.\\nAfter the acute infection subsides, symptoms are\\ngenerated simply by the size of the glands. Extremely\\nlarge tonsils can impair breathing and swallowing,\\nalthough that is quite rare. Large adenoids can impair\\nnose breathing and require a child to breathe through\\nthe mouth.

Most\\nadults have acquired immunity to multiple adenovirus\\ntypes due to infections they had as children.\\nIn one mode of adenovirus infection (called lytic\\ninfection because it destroys large numbers of cells),\\nadenoviruses kill healthy cells and replicate up to\\none million new viruses per cell killed (of which 1-5%\\nare infectious). People with this kind of infection feel\\nsick. In chronic or latent infection, a much smaller num-\\nber of viruses are released and healthy cells can multiply\\nmore rapidly than they are destroyed. People who have\\nthis kind of infection don’t seem to be sick. This is\\nprobably why many adults have immunity to adeno-\\nviruses without realizing they have been infected.\\nChildhood infections\\nIn children, adenoviruses most often cause acute\\nupper respiratory infections with fever and runny nose.\\nAdenovirus types 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are responsible for most\\nof these infections.

Pelvic adhesions can interfere\\nwith the functioning of the ovaries and fallopian tubes\\nand are among the common causes of female inferti-\\nlity.

The phy-\\nsician examines the abdomen and rectum and performs\\na pelvic examination on women. Blood tests and chest\\nand abdominal x rays are taken. Sometimes explora-\\ntory surgery is used to locate the adhesions and\\nsources of pain.\\nAbdominal computed axial tomography—a CT\\nor CAT scan—is the most common diagnostic tool\\nfor SBO and intestinal strangulation due to adhesions.\\nIn this procedure a computer reconstructs a portion\\nof the abdomen from x-ray scans. Barium contrast\\nx-ray studies also may be used to locate an obstruc-\\ntion. The ingestion of a barium solution provides bet-\\nter visualization of the abdominal organs. However\\nsometimes intestinal obstruction or strangulation\\ncannot be confirmed without abdominal surgery.\\nExploratory laparoscopy may be used to detect\\neither abdominal or pelvic adhesions. This procedure\\nusually is performed in a hospital under local orgen-\\neral anesthesia. A small incision is made near the naval\\nand carbon dioxide gas is injected to raise the abdom-\\ninal wall. A tube called a trocar is inserted into the\\nabdomen. The laparascope, equipped with a light and\\na small video camera, is passed through the trocar\\nfor visualization of the peritoneal cavity and the\\nabdominal or pelvic organs.\\nPelvic adhesions also may be detected byhyste-\\nroscopy. In this procedure a uterine endoscope is\\ninserted through the cervix to visualize the cervix and\\nuterine cavity. Withhysterosalpingography (HSG) a\\nradiopaque or contrast dye is injected through a cathe-\\nter in the cervix and x rays are taken of the uterus and\\nfallopian tubes.\\nTreatment\\nAlthough the symptoms of adhesion disease\\nsometimes disappear on their own, adhesions are per-\\nmanent without a surgical procedure called adhesion\\nlysis to disrupt or remove the tissue.\\nAbdominal adhesions\\nSometimes an adhesion-trapped intestine frees\\nitself spontaneously. Surgery may be used to reposi-\\ntion the intestine to relieve symptoms. Various other\\ntechniques include using suction to decompress the\\nintestine; however untreated intestinal adhesions may\\nlead to bowel obstruction.\\nAlthough dilation with an endoscope may be used\\nto widen the region around an intestinal obstruction to\\nrelieve symptoms, SBOs caused almost always require\\nimmediate surgery. In cases of a partial obstruction or\\na complete obstruction without severe symptoms, sur-\\ngery may be delayed for 12–24 hours so that a dehy-\\ndrated patient can be treated with intravenous fluids.\\nA small suction tube may be placed through the nose\\ninto the stomach to remove the stomach contents to\\nrelieve pain and nausea and prevent further bloating.\\nIf an adhesion-related SBO disrupts the blood\\nsupply to part of the intestine, gangrene—tissue\\ndeath—can occur. Strangulation of the bowel usually\\nrequires emergency abdominal surgery to remove the\\nadhesions and restore blood flow to the intestine.\\nIntestinal obstruction repair is performed under gen-\\neral anesthesia. An incision is made in the abdomen,\\nthe obstruction is located, and the adhesions are cut\\naway, releasing the intestine. The bowel is examined\\nfor injury or tissue death. If possible, injured and dead\\nsections are removed and the healthy ends of the intes-\\ntine are stitched together (resectioned). If resectioning\\nis not possible, the ends of the intestine are brought\\nthrough an opening in the abdomen called anostomy.\\nIn some cases laparoscopic surgery can be used to\\nremoved damaged portions of the intestines.

Turkington\\nAdrenal gland cancer\\nDefinition\\nAdrenal gland cancers are rare cancers occuring in\\nthe endocrine tissue of the adrenals. They are charac-\\nterized by overproduction of adrenal gland hormones.\\nDescription\\nCancers of the adrenal gland are very rare. The\\nadrenal gland is a hormone producing endocrine gland\\nwith two main parts, the cortex and the medulla. The\\nmain hormone of the adrenal cortex is cortisol and the\\nmain hormone of the adrenal medulla is epinephrine.\\nWhen tumors develop in the adrenal gland, they\\nsecrete excess amounts of these hormones. Acancer\\nthat arises in the adrenal cortex is called an adreno-\\ncortical carcinoma and can produce high blood pres-\\nsure, weight gain, excess body hair, weakening of the\\nbones and diabetes. A cancer in the adrenal medulla is\\ncalled apheochromocytoma and can cause high blood\\npressure, headache, palpitations, and excessive per-\\nspiration. Although these cancers can happen at any\\nage, most occur in young adults.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIt is not known what causes adrenal gland cancer,\\nbut some cases are associated with hereditary diseases.\\nSymptoms of adrenal cancer are related to the specific\\nhormones produced by that tumor. An adrenocortical\\ncarcinoma typically secretes high amounts of cortisol,\\nproducingCushing’s Syndrome. This syndrome pro-\\nduces progressive weight gain, rounding of the face,\\nand increased blood pressure. Women can experience\\nmenstrual cycle alterations and men can experience\\nfeminization. The symptoms for pheochromocytoma\\ninclude hypertension, acidosis, unexplainedfever and\\nweight loss. Because of the hormones produced by this\\ntype of tumor,anxiety is often a feature also.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis for adrenal cancer usually begins with\\nblood tests to evaluate the hormone levels. These hor-\\nmones include epinephrine, cortisol, and testosterone.\\nIt also includesmagnetic resonance imaging, andcom-\\nputed tomography scansto determine the extent of the\\ndisease. Urine and blood tests can be done to detect\\nthe high levels of hormone secreted by the tumor.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment is aimed at removing the tumor by\\nsurgery. In some cases, this can be done bylaparo-\\nscopy. Surgery is sometimes followed bychemotherapy\\nand/or radiation therapy. Because the surgery removes\\nthe source of many important hormones, hormones\\nmust be supplemented following surgery. If adreno-\\ncortical cancer recurs or has spread to other parts of\\nthe body (metastasized), additional surgery may be\\ndone followed by chemotherapy using the drug\\nmitotane.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAs with any form of cancer, all conventional treat-\\nment options should be considered and applied as\\n66 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAdrenal gland cancer'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 96, 'page_label': '97'}, page_content='appropriate. Nutritional support, as well as support-\\ning the functioning of the entire person diagnosed with\\nadrenal gland cancer throughhomeopathic medicine,\\nacupuncture, vitamin and mineral supplementation,\\nand herbal medicine, can benefit recovery and enhance\\nquality of life.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for adrenal gland cancer is vari-\\nable. For localized pheochromocytomas the 5-year\\nsurvival rate is 95%. This rate decreases with aggres-\\nsive tumors that have metastasized.

This disorder can\\noccur before birth and can lead to sexual abnormal-\\nities in newborns. It can also occur in girls and women\\nlater in life.\\nDescription\\nIn the normal human body, there are two adrenal\\nglands. They are small structures that lie on top of the\\nkidneys. The adrenal glands produce many hormones\\nthat regulate body functions. These hormones include\\nandrogens, or male hormones. Androgens are pro-\\nduced in normal girls and women. Sometimes, one or\\nboth of the adrenal glands becomes enlarged or over-\\nactive, producing more than the usual amount of\\nandrogens. The excess androgens create masculine\\ncharacteristics.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn infants and children, adrenal virilism is usually\\nthe result of adrenal gland enlargement that is present\\nat birth. This is called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\\nThe cause is usually a genetic problem that leads to\\nsevere enzyme deficiencies. In rare cases, adrenal\\nvirilism is caused by an adrenal gland tumor. The\\ntumor can be benign (adrenal adenoma) or cancerous\\n(adrenal carcinoma). Sometimes virilism is caused by a\\ntype of tumor on a woman’s ovary (arrhenoblastoma).\\nNewborn girls with adrenal virilism have external\\nsex organs that seem to be a mixture of male and\\nfemale organs (called female pseudohermaphrodism).\\nNewborn boys with the disorder have enlarged exter-\\nnal sex organs, and these organs develop at an abnor-\\nmally rapid pace.\\nChildren withcongenital adrenal hyperplasiabegin\\ngrowing abnormally fast, but they stop growing earlier\\nthan normal.

In addition, the adrenal glands lie\\nclose to one of the body’s major blood vessels (the\\nvena cava), and to the spleen and the pancreas. The\\nsurgeon needs to remove the gland(s) without dama-\\nging any of these important and delicate organs.\\nDescription\\nOpen adrenalectomy\\nThe surgeon may operate from any of four direc-\\ntions, depending on the exact problem and the\\npatient’s body type.\\nIn the anterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\nabdominal wall. Usually the incision will be horizon-\\ntal, just under the rib cage. If the surgeon intends to\\noperate on only one of the adrenal glands, the incision\\nwill run under just the right or the left side of the rib\\ncage. Sometimes a vertical incision in the middle of the\\nabdomen provides a better approach, especially if\\nboth adrenal glands are involved.\\nIn the posterior approach, the surgeon cuts into\\nthe back, just beneath the rib cage. If both glands are\\nto be removed, an incision is made on each side of the\\nbody. This approach is the most direct route to the\\nadrenal glands, but it does not provide quite as clear a\\nview of the surrounding structures as the anterior\\napproach.\\nIn the flank approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\npatient’s side. This is particularly useful in massively\\nobese patients. If both glands need to be removed, the\\nsurgeon must remove one gland, repair the surgical\\nwound, turn the patient onto the other side, and repeat\\nthe entire process.\\nThe last approach involves an incision into the\\nchest cavity, either with or without part of the incision\\ninto the abdominal cavity. It is used when the surgeon\\nanticipates a very large tumor, or if the surgeon needs\\nto examine or remove nearby structures as well.\\nLaparoscopic adrenalectomy\\nThis technique does not require the surgeon to\\nopen the body cavity. Instead, four small incisions\\n(about 1/2 in diameter each) are made into a patient’s\\nflank, just under the rib cage. A laparoscope, which\\nenables the surgeon to visualize the inside of the\\nabdominal cavity on a television monitor, is placed\\nthrough one of the incisions. The other incisions are\\nfor tubes that carry miniaturized versions of surgical\\ntools. These tools are designed to be operated by\\nmanipulations that the surgeon makes outside the\\nbody.\\nPreparation\\nMost aspects of preparation are the same as in\\nother major operations. In addition, hormone imbal-\\nances are often a major challenge. Whenever possible,\\nphysicians will try to correct hormone imbalances\\nthrough medication in the days or weeks before sur-\\ngery. Adrenal tumors may cause other problems such\\nas hypertension or inadequate potassium in the blood,\\nand these problems also should be resolved if possible\\nbefore surgery is performed. Therefore, a patient may\\ntake specific medicines for days or weeks before\\nsurgery.\\nMost adrenal tumors can be imaged very well with\\na CT scan or MRI, and benign tumors tend to look\\ndifferent on these tests than do cancerous tumors.\\nSurgeons may order a CT scan, MRI, or scintigraphy\\n(viewing of the location of a tiny amount of radio-\\nactive agent) to help locate exactly where the tumor is.\\nThe day before surgery, patients will probably\\nhave an enema to clear the bowels.

The ACTH test is used to deter-\\nmine if too much cortisol is being produced (Cushing’s\\nsyndrome) or if not enough cortisol is being produced\\n(Addison’s disease).\\nPrecautions\\nACTH has diurnal variation, meaning that the\\nlevels of this hormone vary according to the time of\\nday. The highest levels occur in the morning hours.\\nTesting for normal secretion, as well as for Cushing’s\\ndisease, may require multiple samples. For sequential\\nfollow-up, a blood sample analyzed for ACTH should\\nalways be drawn at the same time each day.\\nACTH can be directly measured by an analyzing\\nmethod (immunoassay) in many large laboratories.\\nHowever, smaller laboratories are usually not\\nequipped to perform this test and they may need to\\nsend the blood sample to a larger laboratory. Because\\nof this delay, results may take several days to obtain.\\nDescription\\nACTH production is partly controlled by an area\\nin the center of the brain (the hypothalamus) and partly\\ncontrolled by the level of cortisol in the blood. When\\nACTH levels are too high, cortisol production increases\\nto suppress ACTH release from the pituitary gland. If\\nACTH levels are too low, the hypothalamus produces\\ncorticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to stimulate\\nthe pituitary gland to make more ACTH. ACTH levels\\nrise in response tostress, emotions, injury, infection,\\nburns, surgery, and decreased blood pressure.\\nCushing’s syndrome\\nCushing’s syndrome is caused by an abnormally\\nhigh level of circulating hydrocortisone.

The high level of hydrocortisone may be the\\nresult of taking corticosteroid drugs for a long time.\\nCorticosteroid drugs are widely used for inflammation\\nin disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory\\nbowel disease, andasthma.\\nAddison’s disease\\nAddison’s disease is a rare disorder in which\\nsymptoms are caused by a deficiency of hydrocorti-\\nsone and aldosterone. The most common cause of\\nthis disease is an autoimmune disorder. The immune\\nsystem normally fights foreign invaders in the body\\nlike bacteria. In an autoimmune disorder, the\\nimmune systems attacks the body. In this case, the\\nimmune system produces antibodies that attack\\nthe adrenal glands. Addison’s disease generally pro-\\ngresses slowly, with symptoms developing gradually\\nover months or years. However, acute episodes,\\ncalled Addisonian crises, are brought on by infection,\\ninjury, or other stresses. Diagnosis is generally made\\nif the patient fails to respond to an injection of\\nACTH, which normally stimulates the secretion of\\nhydrocortisone.\\nPreparation\\nA person’s ACTH level is determined from a\\nblood sample. The patient must fast from midnight\\nuntil the test the next morning. This means that the\\npatient cannot eat or drink anything after midnight\\nexcept water. The patient must also avoid radioiso-\\ntope scanning tests or recently administered radioiso-\\ntopes prior to the blood test.\\nRisks\\nThe risks associated with this test are minimal.\\nThey may include slight bleeding from the location\\nwhere the blood was drawn. The patient may feel faint\\nor lightheaded after the blood is drawn. Sometimes\\nthe patient may have an accumulation of blood\\nunder the puncture site (hematoma) after the test.\\nNormal results\\nEach laboratory will have its own set of normal\\nvalues for this test. The normal values can range from:\\nMorning (4-8 A.M.) 8-100 pg/mL or 10-80 ng/L (SI\\nunits) Evening (8-10 P.M.) less than 50 pg/mL or less\\nthan 50 ng/L (SI units)\\nAbnormal results\\nIn Cushing’s syndrome, high levels of ACTH may\\nbe caused by ACTH-producing tumors. These tumors\\nmay be either in the pituitary or in another area (like\\ntumors from lungcancer or ovarian cancer). Low\\nACTH levels may be caused by adrenal enlargement\\ndue to high levels of cortisol and feedback to the\\npituitary.\\nIn Addison’s disease, high levels of ACTH may be\\ncaused by adrenal gland diseases. These diseases\\ndecrease adrenal hormones and the pituitary attempts\\nto increase functioning. Low levels of ACTH may\\noccur because of decreased pituitary function.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nPagana, Kathleen Deska.Mosby’s Manual of Diagnosticand\\nLaboratory Tests.

The childhood form of the disease is the\\nclassical form and is the most severe. Childhood\\nALD is progressive and usually leads to total disabi-\\nlity ordeath. It affects only boys because the genetic\\ndefect is sex-linked (carried on the X chromosome).\\nOnset usually occurs between ages four and ten and\\ncan include many different symptoms, not all of\\nwhich appear together. The most common symptoms\\nare behavioral problems and poor memory. Other\\nsymptoms frequently seen are loss of vision, seizures,\\npoorly articulated speech, difficulty swallowing,\\ndeafness, problems with gait and coordination,fati-\\ngue, increased skin pigmentation, and progressive\\ndementia.\\nThe adult-onset form of the disease, also called\\nadrenomyeloneuropathy, is milder, progresses slowly,\\nis usually associated with a normal life span, and\\nusually appears between ages 21-35. Symptoms may\\ninclude progressive stiffness, weakness, orparalysis of\\nthe lower limbs and loss of coordination. Brain func-\\ntion deterioration may also been seen. Women who\\nare carriers of the disease occasionally experience the\\nsame symptoms, as well as others, including ataxia,\\nhypertonia (excessive muscle tone), mildperipheral\\nneuropathy, and urinary problems. The neonatal\\nform affects both male and female infants and may\\nproduce mental retardation, facial abnormalities, sei-\\nzures, retinal degeneration, poor muscle tone,\\nenlarged liver, and adrenal dysfunction. Neonatal\\nALD usually progresses rapidly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe genetic defect in ALD causes a decrease in the\\nability to degrade very long chain fatty acids. These\\nbuild up in the adrenal glands, brain, plasma, and\\nfibroblasts. The build-up of very long chain fatty\\nacids interferes with the ability of the adrenal gland\\nto convert cholesterol into steroids and causes demye-\\nlination of nerves in the white matter of the brain.\\nDemyelinated nerve cells are unable to function\\nproperly.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made based on observed symptoms, a\\nbiochemical test, and a family history. The biochem-\\nical test detects elevated levels of very long chain fatty\\nacids in samples fromamniocentesis, chorionic villi,\\nplasma, red blood cells, or fibroblasts. A family his-\\ntory may indicate the likelihood of ALD because the\\ndisease is carried on the X-chromosome by the female\\nlineage of families.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for all forms of ALD consists of treat-\\ning the symptoms and supporting the patient with\\nphysical therapy, psychological counseling, and spe-\\ncial education in some cases. There is no cure for this\\ndisease, and there are no drugs that can reverse demye-\\nlination of nerve and brain cells. Dietary measures\\nconsist of reducing the intake of foods high in fat,\\nwhich are a source of very long chain fatty acids.

ARDS is not itself a specific disease, but a\\nsyndrome, a group of symptoms and signs that\\nmake up one of the most important forms of lung or\\nrespiratory failure. It can develop quite suddenly in\\npersons whose lungs have been perfectly normal.\\nVery often ARDS is a true medical emergency. The\\nbasic fault is a breakdown of the barrier, or mem-\\nbrane, that normally keeps fluid from leaking out of\\nthe small blood vessels of the lung into the breathing\\nsacs (the alveoli).\\nDescription\\nAnother name for ARDS is shock lung. Its formal\\nname is misleading, because children, as well as adults,\\nmay be affected. In the lungs the smallest blood ves-\\nsels, or capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny\\nair sacs at the tips of the smallest breathing tubes (the\\nbronchi). This is the all-important site where oxygen\\npasses from air that is inhaled to the blood, which\\ncarries it to all parts of the body. Any form of lung\\ninjury that damages this point of contact, called the\\nalveolo-capillary junction, will allow blood and tissue\\nfluid to leak into the alveoli, eventually filling them so\\nthat air cannot enter. The result is the type of breath-\\ning distress called ARDS. ARDS is one of the major\\ncauses of excess fluid in the lungs, the other beingheart\\nfailure.\\nAlong with fluid there is a marked increase in\\ninflamed cells in the lungs. There also is debris left\\nover from damaged lung cells, and fibrin, a semi-\\nsolid material derived from blood in the tissues.\\nTypically these materials join together with large\\nmolecules in the blood (proteins), to form hyaline\\nmembranes. (These membranes are very prominent\\nin premature infants who develop respiratory distress\\nsyndrome; it is often called hyaline membrane dis-\\nease.) If ARDS is very severe or lasts a long time, the\\nlungs do not heal, but rather become scarred, a process\\nknown as fibrosis. The lack of a normal amount of\\noxygen causes the blood vessels of the lung to become\\nnarrower, and in time they, too, may become scarred\\nand filled with clotted blood. The lungs as a whole\\nbecome very ‘‘stiff,’’ and it becomes much harder for\\nthe patient to breathe.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA very wide range of diseases or toxic substances,\\nincluding some drugs, can cause ARDS. They include:\\n/C15Breathing in (aspiration) of the stomach contents\\nwhen regurgitated, or salt water or fresh water from\\nnearly drowning.\\n/C15Inhaling smoke, as in a fire; toxic materials in the air,\\nsuch as ammonia or hydrocarbons; or too much\\noxygen, which itself can injure the lungs.\\n/C15Infection by a virus or bacterium, orsepsis, a wide-\\nspread infection that gets into the blood.\\n/C15Massive trauma, with severe injury to any part of the\\nbody.\\n/C15Shock with persistently low blood pressure may not\\nin itself cause ARDS, but it can be an important\\nfactor.\\n/C15A blood clotting disorder called disseminated intra-\\nvascular coagulation, in which blood clots form in\\nvessels throughout the body, including the lungs.\\n/C15A large amount of fat entering the circulation and\\ntraveling to the lungs, where it lodges in small blood\\nvessels, injuring the cells lining the vessel walls.\\n/C15An overdose of a narcotic drug, a sedative, or, rarely,\\naspirin.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAlveoli— The tiny air sacs at the ends of the breath-\\ning tubes of the lung where oxygen normally is\\ntaken up by the capillaries to enter the circulation.\\nAspiration— The process in which solid food,\\nliquids, or secretions that normally are swallowed\\nare, instead, breathed into the lungs.\\nCapillaries— The smallest arteries which, in the\\nlung, are located next to the alveoli so that they\\ncan pick up oxygen from inhaled air.\\nFace mask— The simplest way of delivering a high\\nlevel of oxygen to patients with ARDS or other low-\\noxygen conditions.\\nSteroids— A class of drugs resembling normal body\\nsubstances that often help control inflammation in\\nthe body tissues.\\nVentilator— A mechanical device that can take\\nover the work of breathing for a patient whose\\nlungs are injured or are starting to heal.\\n74 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAdult respiratory distress syndrome'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 104, 'page_label': '105'}, page_content='/C15Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), when\\nblood proteins, called enzymes, pass to the lungs\\nand injure lung cells.\\n/C15Severe burn injury.\\n/C15Injury of the brain, or bleeding into the brain, from\\nany cause may be a factor in ARDS for reasons that\\nare not clear. Convulsions also may cause some\\ncases.\\nUsually ARDS develops within one to two days of\\nthe original illness or injury. The person begins to take\\nrapid but shallow breaths. The doctor who listens to\\nthe patient’s chest with a stethoscope may hear\\n‘‘crackling’’ orwheezing sounds. The low blood oxy-\\ngen content may cause the skin to appear mottled or\\neven blue. As fluid continues to fill the breathing sacs,\\nthe patient may have great trouble breathing, take\\nvery rapid breaths, and gasp for air.\\nDiagnosis\\nA simple test using a device applied to the ear will\\nshow whether the blood is carrying too little oxygen,\\nand this can be confirmed by analyzing blood taken\\nfrom an artery. Thechest x raymay be normal in the\\nearly stages, but, in a short time, fluid will be seen\\nwhere it does not belong. The two lungs are about\\nequally affected. A heart of normal size indicates that\\nthe problem actually is ARDS and not heart failure.\\nAnother way a physician can distinguish between\\nthese two possibilities is to place a catheter into a\\nvein and advance it into the main artery of the lung.\\nIn this way, the pressure within the pulmonary capil-\\nlaries can be measured. Pressure within the pulmonary\\ncapillaries is elevated in heart failure, but normal\\nin ARDS.\\nTreatment\\nThe three main goals in treating patients with\\nARDS are:\\n/C15To treat whatever injury or disease has caused\\nARDS. Examples are: to treat septic infection with\\nthe properantibiotics, and to reduce the level of\\noxygen therapy if ARDS has resulted from a toxic\\nlevel of oxygen.\\n/C15To control the process in the lungs that allows fluid\\nto leak out of the blood vessels. At present there\\nis no certain way to achieve this. Certain steroid\\nhormones have been tried because they can combat\\ninflammation, but the actual results have been\\ndisappointing.\\n/C15To make sure the patient gets enough oxygen until\\nthe lung injury has had time to heal. If oxygen deliv-\\nered by a face mask is not enough, the patient is\\nplaced on a ventilator, which takes over breathing,\\nand, through a tube placed in the nose or mouth (or\\nan incision in the windpipe), forces oxygen into the\\nlungs. This treatment must be closely supervised, and\\nthe pressure adjusted so that too much oxygen is not\\ndelivered.\\nPatients with ARDS should be cared for in an\\nintensive care unit, where experienced staff and all\\nneeded equipment are available. Enough fluid must\\nbe provided, by vein if necessary, to preventdehydra-\\ntion. Also, the patient’s nutritional state must be main-\\ntained, again by vein, if oral intake is not sufficient.\\nPrognosis\\nIf the patient’s lung injury does not soon begin to\\nheal, the lack of sufficient oxygen can injure other\\norgans, such as the kidneys. There always is a risk\\nthat bacterial pneumonia will develop at some point.\\nWithout prompt treatment, as many as 90% of\\npatients with ARDS can be expected to die. With\\nmodern treatment, however, about half of all patients\\nwill survive. Those who do live usually recover com-\\npletely, with little or no long-term breathing difficulty.\\nLung scarring is a risk after a long period on a venti-\\nlator, but it may improve in the months after the\\npatient is taken off ventilation. Whether a particular\\npatient will recover depends to a great extent on\\nwhether the primary disease that caused ARDS to\\ndevelop in the first place can be effectively treated.\\nPrevention\\nThe only way to prevent ARDS is to avoid those\\ndiseases and harmful conditions that damage the lung.\\nFor instance, the danger of aspirating stomach con-\\ntents into the lungs can be avoided by making sure a\\npatient does not eat shortly before receivinggeneral\\nanesthesia. If a patient needsoxygen therapy,a sl o wa\\nlevel as possible should be given. Any form of lung\\ninfection, or infection anywhere in the body that gets\\ninto the blood, must be treated promptly to avoid the\\nlung injury that causes ARDS.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nSmolley, Lawrence A., and Debra F.

The upward limit of the life span, however,\\ncan be as high as 120 years. During the latter half of\\nlife, an individual is more prone to have problems with\\nthe various functions of the body and to develop any\\nnumber of chronic or fatal diseases. The cardiovascu-\\nlar, digestive, excretory, nervous, reproductive and\\nurinary systems are particularly affected. The most\\ncommon diseases of aging include Alzheimer’s, arthri-\\ntis, cancer, diabetes, depression, and heart disease.\\nDescription\\nHuman beings reach a peak of growth and devel-\\nopment around the time of their mid 20s. Aging is the\\nnormal transition time after that flurry of activity.\\nAlthough there are quite a few age-related changes\\nthat tax the body, disability is not necessarily a part\\nof aging. Health and lifestyle factors together with\\nthe genetic makeup of the individual, and determines\\nthe response to these changes. Body functions that are\\nmost often affected by age include:\\n/C15Hearing, which declines especially in relation to the\\nhighest pitched tones.\\n/C15The proportion of fat to muscle, which may increase\\nby as much as 30%. Typically, the total padding of\\nbody fat directly under the skin thins out and accu-\\nmulates around the stomach. The ability to excrete\\nfats is impaired, and therefore the storage of fats\\nincreases, including cholesterol and fat-soluble\\nnutrients.\\n/C15The amount of water in the body decreases, which\\ntherefore decreases the absorption of water-soluble\\nnutrients. Also, there is less saliva and other lubricat-\\ning fluids.\\n/C15The liver and the kidneys cannot function as effi-\\nciently, thus affecting the elimination of wastes.\\n/C15A decrease in the ease of digestion, with a decrease in\\nstomach acid production.\\n/C15A loss of muscle strength and coordination, with an\\naccompanying loss of mobility, agility, and\\nflexibility.\\n/C15A decline in sexual hormones and sexual functioning.\\n/C15A decrease in the sensations of taste and smell.\\n/C15Changes in the cardiovascular and respiratory sys-\\ntems, leading to decreased oxygen and nutrients\\nthroughout the body.\\n/C15Decreased functioning of the nervous system so that\\nnerve impulses are not transmitted as efficiently,\\nreflexes are not as sharp, and memory and learning\\nare diminished.\\n/C15A decrease in bone strength and density.\\n/C15Hormone levels, which gradually decline.

The most commonly held theory\\nof aging, it is based on the fact that ongoing chemical\\nreactions of the cells produce free radicals. In the\\npresence of oxygen, these free radicals cause the\\ncells of the body to break down. As time goes on,\\nmore cells die or lose the ability to function, and the\\nbody soon ceases to function as a whole.\\n/C15Immunological theory.

Also, as the system breaks\\ndown, the body is more apt to have autoimmune\\nreactions, in which the body’s own cells are mistaken\\nfor foreign material and are destroyed or damaged\\nby the immune system.\\nDiagnosis\\nMany problems can arise due to age-related\\nchanges in the body. Although there is no one test to\\nbe given, a thorough physical exam and a basic blood\\nscreening and blood chemistry panel can point to\\nareas in need of further attention. When older people\\nbecome ill, the first signs of disease are often nonspe-\\ncific. Further exams should be conducted if any of the\\nfollowing occur:\\n/C15diminished or lack of desire for food\\n/C15increasing confusion\\n/C15failure to thrive\\n/C15urinary incontinence\\n/C15dizziness\\n/C15weight loss\\n/C15falling\\nTreatment\\nFor the most part, doctors prescribe medications\\nto control the symptoms and diseases of aging. In the\\nUnited States, about two-thirds of people 65 and over\\ntake medications for various complaints. More\\nwomen than men use these medications. The most\\ncommon drugs used by the elderly are painkillers,\\ndiureticsor water pills, sedatives, cardiac drugs,anti-\\nbiotics, and mental health drugs.\\nEstrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is com-\\nmonly prescribed to postmenopausal women for\\nsymptoms of aging. It is often used in conjunction\\nwith progesterone. ERT functions to help keep bones\\nstrong, reduce risk of heart disease, restore vaginal\\nlubrication, and to improve skin elasticity.

Agoraphobia is\\ntwice as common in women as in men and usually\\nstrikes between the ages of 15-35.\\nThe symptoms of the panic attacks which may\\naccompany agoraphobia vary from person to person,\\nand may include trembling, sweating, heartpalpita-\\ntions (a feeling of the heart pounding against the\\nchest), jitters, fatigue, tingling in the hands and feet,\\nnausea, a rapid pulse or breathing rate, and a sense of\\nimpending doom.\\nAgoraphobia and other phobias are thought to be\\nthe result of a number of physical and environmental\\nfactors. For instance, they have been associated with\\nbiochemical imbalances, especially related to certain neu-\\nrotransmitters (chemical nerve messengers) in the brain.\\nPeople who have a panic attack in a given situation\\n(e.g., a shopping mall) may begin to associate the panic\\nwith that situation and learn to avoid it.

The doctor can\\ndiagnose the underlying panic or anxiety disorder\\nand make sure the symptoms aren’t related to some\\nother underlying medical condition.\\nThe doctor makes the diagnosis of agoraphobia\\nbased primarily on the patient’s description of his or\\nher symptoms. The person with agoraphobia experi-\\nences anxiety in situations where escape is difficult or\\nhelp is unavailable–or in certain situations, such as\\nbeing alone. While many people are somewhat appre-\\nhensive in these situations, the hallmark of agorapho-\\nbia is that a person’s active avoidance of the feared\\nsituation impairs his or her ability to work, socialize,\\nor otherwise function.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for agoraphobia usually consists of\\nboth medication and psychotherapy.

It was first recognized in the\\nUnited States in 1981. AIDS is the advanced form of\\ninfection with the HIV virus, which may not cause\\nrecognizable disease for a long period after the initial\\nexposure (latency). No vaccine is currently available to\\nprevent HIV infection. At present, all forms of AIDS\\ntherapy are focused on improving the quality and\\nlength of life for AIDS patients by slowing or halting\\nthe replication of the virus and treating or preventing\\ninfections and cancers that take advantage of a per-\\nson’s weakened immune system.\\nDescription\\nAIDS is considered one of the most devastating\\npublic health problems in recent history. In June 2000,\\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n(CDC) reported that 120,223 (includes only those\\ncases in areas that have confidential HIV reporting)\\nin the United States are HIV-positive, and 311,701 are\\nliving with AIDS (includes only those cases where vital\\nstatus is known). Of these patients, 44% are gay or\\nbisexual men, 20% are heterosexual intravenous drug\\nusers, and 17% are women. In addition, approxi-\\nmately 1,000-2,000 children are born each year with\\nHIV infection. The World Health Organization\\n(WHO) estimates that 33 million adults and 1.3 mil-\\nlion children worldwide were living with HIV/AIDS as\\nof 1999 with 5.4 million being newly infected that year.\\nMost of these cases are in the developing countries of\\nAsia and Africa.\\n80 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAIDS'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 110, 'page_label': '111'}, page_content='Risk factors\\nAIDS can be transmitted in several ways. The risk\\nfactors for HIV transmissionvaryaccording to category:\\n/C15Sexual contact. Persons at greatest risk are those who\\ndo not practice safe sex, those who are not monoga-\\nmous, those who participate in anal intercourse, and\\nthose who have sex with a partner with symptoms of\\nadvanced HIV infection and/or other sexually trans-\\nmitted diseases (STDs). In the United States and\\nEurope, most cases of sexually transmitted HIV infec-\\ntion have resulted from homosexual contact, whereas\\ninAfrica,thediseaseisspreadprimarilythroughsexual\\nintercourse among heterosexuals.\\n/C15Transmission in pregnancy. High-risk mothers\\ninclude women married to bisexual men or men\\nwho have an abnormal blood condition calledhemo-\\nphilia and require blood transfusions, intravenous\\ndrug users, and women living in neighborhoods\\nwith a high rate of HIV infection among heterosex-\\nuals. The chances of transmitting the disease to the\\nchild are higher in women in advanced stages of the\\ndisease. Breast feeding increases the risk of transmis-\\nsion by 10-20%. The use of zidovudine (AZT) during\\npregnancy, however, can decrease the risk of trans-\\nmission to the baby.\\n/C15Exposure to contaminated blood or blood products.\\nWith the introduction of blood product screening in\\nthe mid-1980s, the incidence of HIV transmission in\\nbloodtransfusionshasdroppedtooneinevery100,000\\ntransfused. With respect to HIV transmission among\\ndrug abusers, risk increases with the duration of using\\ninjections, the frequency of needle sharing, the num-\\nber of persons who share a needle, and the number of\\nAIDS cases in the local population.\\n/C15Needle sticks among health care professionals.\\nPresent studies indicate that the risk of HIV trans-\\nmission by a needle stick is about one in 250. This\\nrate can be decreased if the injured worker is given\\nAZT, an anti-retroviral medication, in combination\\nwith other medication.\\nHIV is not transmitted by handshakes or other\\ncasual non-sexual contact, coughing or sneezing, or by\\nbloodsucking insects such as mosquitoes.\\nAIDS in women\\nAIDS in women is a serious public health concern.\\nWomen exposed to HIV infection through hetero-\\nsexual contact are the most rapidly growing risk\\ngroup in the United States population. The percentage\\nof AIDS cases diagnosed in women has risen from 7%\\nin 1985 to 23% in 1999. Women diagnosed with AIDS\\nmay not live as long as men, although the reasons for\\nthis finding are unclear.\\nAIDS in children\\nSince AIDS can be transmitted from an infected\\nmother to the child during pregnancy, during the birth\\nprocess, or through breast milk, all infants born to\\nHIV-positive mothers are a high-risk group. As of\\n2000, it was estimated that 87% of HIV-positive\\nwomen are of childbearing age; 41% of them are\\ndrug abusers. Between 15-30% of children born to\\nHIV-positive women will be infected with the virus.\\nAIDS is one of the 10 leading causes ofdeath in\\nchildren between one and four years of age. The inter-\\nval between exposure to HIV and the development of\\nAIDS is shorter in children than in adults. Infants\\ninfected with HIV have a 20-30% chance of develop-\\ning AIDS within a year and dying before age three. In\\nthe remainder, AIDS progresses more slowly; the\\naverage child patient survives to seven years of age.\\nSome survive into early adolescence.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBecause HIV destroys immune system cells, AIDS\\nis a disease that can affect any of the body’s major\\norgan systems.

In AIDS, immu-\\nnodeficiency results from the way that the virus binds\\nto a protein called CD4, which is primarily found on\\nthe surface of certain subtypes of white blood cells\\ncalled helper T cells or CD4 cells. After the virus has\\nattached to the CD4 receptor, the virus-CD4 complex\\nrefolds to uncover another receptor called a chemo-\\nkine receptor that helps to mediate entry of the virus\\ninto the cell. One chemokine receptor in particular,\\nCCR5, has gotten recent attention after studies\\nshowed that defects in its structure (caused by genetic\\nmutations) cause the progression of AIDS to be pre-\\nvented or slowed. Scientists hope that this discovery\\nwill lead to the development of drugs that trigger an\\nartificial mutation of the CCR5 gene or target the\\nCCR5 receptor.\\nOnce HIV has entered the cell, it can replicate\\nintracellularly and kill the cell in ways that are still\\nnot completely understood. In addition to killing some\\nlymphocytes directly, the AIDS virus disrupts the\\nfunctioning of the remaining CD4 cells. Because the\\nimmune system cells are destroyed, many different\\ntypes of infections and cancers that take advantage\\nof a person’s weakened immune system (opportunis-\\ntic) can develop.\\nAutoimmunity is a condition in which the body’s\\nimmune system produces antibodies that work against\\nits own cells. Antibodies are specific proteins pro-\\nduced in response to exposure to a specific, usually\\nforeign, protein or particle called an antigen. In this\\ncase, the body produces antibodies that bind to blood\\nplatelets that are necessary for proper blood clotting\\nand tissue repair. Once bound, the antibodies mark the\\nplatelets for removal from the body, and they are\\nfiltered out by the spleen. Some AIDS patients develop\\na disorder, called immune-related thrombocytopenia\\npurpura (ITP), in which the number of blood platelets\\ndrops to abnormally low levels.\\nResearchers do not know precisely how HIV\\nattacks the nervous system since the virus can cause\\ndamage without infecting nerve cells directly.

Most patients are not recognized as infected\\nduring this phase and may not seek medical attention.\\nThe symptoms may include fever, fatigue, muscle\\naches, loss of appetite, digestive disturbances, weight\\nloss, skinrashes, headache, and chronically swollen\\nlymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). Approximately 25-\\n33% of patients will experience a form ofmeningitis\\nduring this phase in which the membranes that cover\\nthe brain and spinal cord become inflamed. Acute\\nretroviral syndrome develops between one and six\\nweeks after infection and lasts for two to three\\nweeks. Blood tests during this period will indicate the\\npresence of virus (viremia) and the appearance of the\\nviral p24 antigen in the blood.\\nLatency period\\nAfter the HIV virus enters a patient’s lymph nodes\\nduring the acute retroviral syndrome stage, the disease\\nbecomes latent for as many as 10 years or more before\\nsymptoms of advanced disease develop. During\\nlatency, the virus continues to replicate in the lymph\\nnodes, where it may cause one or more of the following\\nconditions:\\nPERSISTENT GENERALIZED LYMPHADENOPATHY\\n(PGL). Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, or\\nPGL, is a condition in which HIV continues to pro-\\nduce chronic painless swellings in the lymph nodes\\nduring the latency period. The lymph nodes that are\\nmost frequently affected by PGL are those in the areas\\nof the neck, jaw, groin, and armpits. PGL affects\\nbetween 50-70% of patients during latency.\\nCONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS. Many patients will\\ndevelop low-grade fevers, chronicfatigue, and general\\nweakness. HIV may also cause a combination of food\\nmalabsorption, loss of appetite, and increased meta-\\nbolism that contribute to the so-called AIDS wasting\\nor wasting syndrome.\\nOTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS. At any time during the\\ncourse of HIV infection, patients may suffer from a\\nyeast infection in the mouth called thrush, open sores\\nor ulcers, or other infections of the mouth;diarrhea\\nand other gastrointestinal symptoms that causemal-\\nnutrition and weight loss; diseases of the lungs and\\nkidneys; and degeneration of the nerve fibers in the\\narms and legs. HIV infection of the nervous system\\nleads to general loss of strength, loss of reflexes, and\\nfeelings ofnumbness or burning sensations in the feet\\nor lower legs.\\nLate-stage disease (AIDS)\\nAIDS is usually marked by a very low number of\\nCD4+ lymphocytes, followed by a rise in the fre-\\nquency of opportunistic infections and cancers.\\nDoctors monitor the number and proportion of\\nCD4+ lymphocytes in the patient’s blood in order to\\nassess the progression of the disease and the effective-\\nness of different medications. About 10% of infected\\nindividuals never progress to this overt stage of the\\ndisease and are referred to as nonprogressors.\\nOPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS. Once the patient’s\\nCD4+ lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/mm3,\\nhe or she is at risk for a variety of opportunistic infec-\\ntions. The infectious organisms may include the\\nfollowing:\\n/C15Fungi. The most common fungal disease associated\\nwith AIDS isPneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).\\nPCP is the immediate cause of death in 15-20% of\\nAIDS patients. It is an important measure of a\\npatient’s prognosis. Other fungal infections include\\na yeast infection of the mouth (candidiasis or thrush)\\nand cryptococcal meningitis.\\n/C15Protozoa. Toxoplasmosis is a common opportunistic\\ninfection in AIDS patients that is caused by a proto-\\nzoan. Other diseases in this category include isopor-\\niasis and cryptosporidiosis.\\n/C15Mycobacteria. AIDS patients may developtubercu-\\nlosis or MAC infections. MAC infections are caused\\nby Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare , and occur in\\nabout 40% of AIDS patients. It is rare until CD4+\\ncounts falls below 50 cells/mm3.\\n/C15Bacteria. AIDS patients are likely to develop bacter-\\nial infections of the skin and digestive tract.\\n/C15Viruses. AIDS patients are highly vulnerable to cyto-\\nmegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV),\\nvaricella zoster virus (VZV), and Epstein-Barr virus\\n(EBV) infections.

Hairy leukoplakia is a white area of diseased\\ntissue on the tongue that may be flat or slightly raised.\\nIt is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.\\nAIDS-RELATED CANCERS. Patients with late-stage\\nAIDS may develop Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), a skin\\ntumor that primarily affects homosexual men. KS is\\nthe most common AIDS-related malignancy. It is\\ncharacterized by reddish-purple blotches or patches\\n(brownish in African-Americans) on the skin or in\\nthe mouth. About 40% of patients with KS develop\\nsymptoms in the digestive tract or lungs. KS may be\\ncaused by a herpes virus-like sexually transmitted dis-\\nease agent rather than HIV.\\nThe second most common form ofcancer in AIDS\\npatients is a tumor of the lymphatic system (lym-\\nphoma). AIDS-related lymphomas often affect the\\ncentral nervous system and develop very aggressively.\\nInvasive cancer of the cervix (related to certain\\ntypes of human papilloma virus [HPV]) is an impor-\\ntant diagnostic marker of AIDS in women.\\nWhile incidence of AIDS-defining cancers such as\\nKaposi’s sarcoma andcervical cancerhave decreased\\nsince increase use of antiretroviral therapy, other can-\\ncers has increased in AIDS patients. People with HIV\\nhas shown higher incidence of lung cancer, head and\\nneck cancers, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, melanoma, and\\nanorectal cancer from 1992 to 2002.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause HIV infection produces such a wide\\nrange of symptoms, the CDC has drawn up a list\\nof 34 conditions regarded as defining AIDS. The\\nphysician will use the CDC list to decide whether the\\npatient falls into one of these three groups:\\n/C15definitive diagnoses with or without laboratory evi-\\ndence of HIV infection\\n/C15definitive diagnoses with laboratory evidence of HIV\\ninfection\\n/C15presumptive diagnoses with laboratory evidence of\\nHIV infection.\\nPhysical findings\\nAlmost all the symptoms of AIDS can occur with\\nother diseases. The generalphysical examinationmay\\nrange from normal findings to symptoms that are\\nclosely associated with AIDS. These symptoms are\\nhairy leukoplakia of the tongue and Kaposi’s sar-\\ncoma. When the doctor examines the patient, he or\\nshe will look for the overall pattern of symptoms\\nrather than any one finding.\\nLaboratory tests for HIV infection\\nBLOOD TESTS (SEROLOGY). The first blood test\\nfor AIDS was developed in 1985. At present, patients\\nwho are being tested for HIV infection are usually\\ngiven an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\\n(ELISA) test for the presence of HIV antibody in\\ntheir blood. Positive ELISA results are then tested\\nwith a Western blot or immunofluorescence (IFA)\\nassay for confirmation. The combination of the\\nELISA and Western blot tests is more than 99.9%\\naccurate in detecting HIV infection within four to\\neight weeks following exposure. The polymerase\\nchain reaction (PCR) test can be used to detect the\\npresence of viral nucleic acids in the very small number\\nof HIV patients who have false-negative results on the\\nELISA and Western blot tests. These tests are also\\nused to detect viruses and bacterium other than HIV\\nand AIDS.\\nOTHER LABORATORY TESTS. In addition to diag-\\nnostic blood tests, there are other blood tests that are\\nused to track the course of AIDS in patients that have\\nalready been diagnosed. These include blood counts,\\nviral load tests, p24 antigen assays, and measurements\\nof/C122-microglobulin (/C122M).\\nDoctors will use a wide variety of tests to diagnose\\nthe presence of opportunistic infections, cancers, or\\nother disease conditions in AIDS patients. Tissue\\nbiopsies, samples of cerebrospinal fluid, and sophisti-\\ncated imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance\\nimaging (MRI) and computed tomography scans (CT)\\nare used to diagnose AIDS-related cancers, some\\nopportunistic infections, damage to the central\\n86 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAIDS'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 116, 'page_label': '117'}, page_content='nervous system, and wasting of the muscles. Urine and\\nstool samples are used to diagnose infections caused\\nby parasites. AIDS patients are also given blood tests\\nfor syphilis and othersexually transmitted diseases.\\nDiagnosis in children\\nDiagnostic blood testing in children older than 18\\nmonths is similar to adult testing, with ELISA screen-\\ning confirmed by Western blot. Younger infants can\\nbe diagnosed by direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR\\ntesting, and p24 antigen testing.\\nIn terms of symptoms, children are less likely than\\nadults to have an early acute syndrome. They are,\\nhowever, likely to have delayed growth, a history of\\nfrequent illness, recurrent ear infections, a low blood\\ncell count, failure to gain weight, and unexplained\\nfevers. Children with AIDS are more likely to develop\\nbacterial infections, inflammation of the lungs, and\\nAIDS-related brain disorders than are HIV-positive\\nadults.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for AIDS covers four considerations:\\nTREATMENT OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS AND\\nMALIGNANCIES. Most AIDS patients require complex\\nlong-term treatment with medications for infectious\\ndiseases. This treatment is often complicated by the\\ndevelopment of resistance in the disease organisms.\\nAIDS-related malignancies in the central nervous sys-\\ntem are usually treated with radiation therapy.\\nCancers elsewhere in the body are treated with\\nchemotherapy.\\nPROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT FOR OPPORTUNISTIC\\nINFECTIONS. Prophylactic treatment is treatment that\\nis given to prevent disease. AIDS patients with a his-\\ntory ofPneumocystis pneumonia; with CD4+ counts\\nbelow 200 cells/mm3 or 14% of lymphocytes; weight\\nloss; or thrush should be given prophylactic medica-\\ntions. The three drugs given are trimethoprim-\\nsulfamethoxazole, dapsone, or pentamidine in aerosol\\nform.\\nANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENT. In recent years\\nresearchers have developed drugs that suppress HIV\\nreplication, as distinct from treating its effects on the\\nbody. These drugs fall into four classes:\\n/C15Nucleotide analogues. These drugs work by interfer-\\ning with the action of HIV reverse transcriptase\\ninside infected cells, thus ending the virus’ replication\\nprocess. These drugs include zidovudine (sometimes\\ncalled azidothymidine or AZT), didanosine (ddI),\\nzalcitabine (ddC), stavudine (d4T), lamivudine\\n(3TC), and abacavir (ABC).\\n/C15Protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors can be effec-\\ntive against HIV strains that have developed resis-\\ntance to nucleoside analogues, and are often used in\\ncombination with them. These compounds include\\nsaquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprena-\\nvir, and lopinavir..\\n/C15Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. This\\nis a new class of antiretroviral agents. Three are\\navailable, nevirapine, which was approved first, dela-\\nvirdine and efavirin.\\n/C15Fusion inhibitors, the newest class of antiretrovirals.\\nThey block specific proteins on the surface of the\\nvirus or the CD4 cell. These proteins help the virus\\ngain entry into the cell.The only FDA approved\\nfusion inhibitor as of spring 2004 was enfuvirtide.\\nTreatment guidelines for these agents are in con-\\nstant change as new medications are developed and\\nintroduced. Two principles currently guide doctors in\\nworking out drug regimens for AIDS patients: using\\ncombinations of drugs rather than one medication\\nalone; and basing treatment decisions on the results\\nof the patient’s viral load tests.\\nSTIMULATION OF BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION.\\nBecause many patients with AIDS suffer from abnor-\\nmally low levels of both red and white blood cells,\\nthey may be given medications to stimulate blood cell\\nproduction. Epoetin alfa (erythropoietin) may be\\ngiven to anemic patients. Patients with low white\\nblood cell counts may be given filgrastim or\\nsargramostim.\\nTreatment in women\\nTreatment of pregnant women with HIV is parti-\\ncularly important in that anti-retroviral therapy\\nhas been shown to reduce transmission to the infant\\nby 65%.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for AIDS can be grouped\\ninto two categories: those intended to help the immune\\nsystem and those aimed atpain control. Treatments\\nthat may enhance the function of the immune system\\ninclude Chinese herbal medicine and western herbal\\nmedicine, macrobiotic and other specialdiets, guided\\nimagery and creative visualization, homeopathy, and\\nvitamin therapy. Pain control therapies includehydro-\\ntherapy, reiki, acupuncture, meditation, chiropractic\\ntreatments, and therapeutic massage.

These tests sometimes are called AIDS\\nserology tests. Serology is the branch of immunology\\nthat deals with the contents and characteristics of\\nblood serum. Serum is the clear light yellow part\\nof blood that remains liquid when blood cells form\\na clot.

Some AIDS tests also can be\\nused to screen blood donations for safe use in\\ntransfusions.\\nIn order to understand the different purposes\\nof the blood tests used with AIDS patients, it is help-\\nful to understand how HIV infection affects human\\nblood and the immune system. HIV is a retrovirus that\\nenters the blood stream of a new host in the following\\nways:\\n/C15by sexual contact\\n/C15by contact with infected body fluids (such as blood\\nand urine)\\n/C15by transmission duringpregnancy,o r\\n/C15through transfusion of infected blood products\\nA retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique\\nenzyme called reverse transcriptase that allows it to\\nreplicate within new host cells. The virus binds to a\\nprotein called CD4, which is found on the surface of\\ncertain subtypes of white blood cells, including helper\\nT cells, macrophages, and monocytes. Once HIV\\nenters the cell, it can replicate and kill the cell in\\nways that are still not completely understood. In addi-\\ntion to killing some lymphocytes directly, the AIDS\\nvirus disrupts the functioning of the remaining CD4\\ncells. CD4 cells ordinarily produce a substance called\\ninterleukin-2 (IL-2), which stimulates other cells\\n(T cells and B cells) in the human immune system\\nto respond to infections. Without the IL-2, T cells do\\nnot reproduce as they normally would in response to the\\nHIV virus, and B cells are not stimulated to respond\\nto the infection.\\nPrecautions\\nIn some states such as New York, a signed consent\\nform is needed in order to administer an AIDS test. As\\nwith all blood tests, healthcare professionals should\\nalways wear latex gloves and avoid being pricked by\\nthe needle used in drawing blood for the tests. It may\\nbe difficult to get blood from a habitual intravenous\\ndrug user due to collapsed veins.\\nDescription\\nDiagnostic tests\\nDiagnostic blood tests for AIDS usually are given\\nto persons in high-risk populations who may have\\nbeen exposed to HIV or who have the early symptoms\\nof AIDS. Most persons infected with HIV will develop\\na detectable level of antibody within three months of\\ninfection. The condition of testing positive for HIV\\nantibody in the blood is called seroconversion, and\\npersons who have become HIV-positive are called\\nseroconverters.\\nIt is possible to diagnose HIV infection by isolat-\\ning the virus itself from a blood sample or by demon-\\nstrating the presence of HIV antigen in the blood.\\nViral culture, however, is expensive, not widely avail-\\nable, and slow—it takes 28 days to complete the viral\\nculture test. More common are blood tests that work\\nby detecting the presence of antibodies to the HIV\\nvirus. These tests are inexpensive, widely available,\\nand accurate in detecting 99.9% of AIDS infections\\nwhen used in combination to screen patients and\\nconfirm diagnoses.\\nENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA).\\nThis type of blood test is used to screen blood for\\ntransfusions as well as diagnose patients. An ELISA\\ntest for HIV works by attaching HIV antigens to a\\nplastic well or beads. A sample of the patient’s blood\\nserum is added, and excess proteins are removed.\\nA second antibody coupled to an enzyme is added,\\nfollowed by addition of a substance that will cause\\nthe enzyme to react by forming a color. An instru-\\nment called a spectrophotometer can measure the\\ncolor. The name of the test is derived from the use\\nof the enzyme that is coupled or linked to the second\\nantibody.\\nA three-dimensional model of the HIV virus. (Corbis\\nCorporation (New York).

The\\nmeasurements taken in a CBC include a white blood\\ncell count, a red blood cell count, the red cell dis-\\ntribution width, the hematocrit (ratio of the volume\\nof the red blood cells to the blood volume), and the\\namount of hemoglobin (the blood protein that carries\\noxygen).

A second antibody\\ncoupled to an enzyme is added, followed by a che-\\nmical that will cause a color reaction that can be\\nmeasured by a special instrument.\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)— A transmis-\\nsible retrovirus that causes AIDS in humans. Two\\nforms of HIV are now recognized: HIV-1, which\\ncauses most cases of AIDS in Europe, North and\\nSouth America, and most parts of Africa; and\\nHIV-2, which is chiefly found in West African\\npatients. HIV-2, discovered in 1986, appears to be\\nless virulent than HIV-1, but also may have a longer\\nlatency period.\\nImmunofluorescent assay (IFA)— A blood test some-\\ntimes used to confirm ELISA results instead of using\\nthe Western blotting.

If the second ELISA is\\npositive, the result should be confirmed by the\\nWestern blot test.\\nWESTERN BLOT (IMMUNOBLOT). The Western blot\\nor immunoblot test is used as a reference procedure to\\nconfirm the diagnosis of AIDS. In Western blot test-\\ning, HIV antigen is purified by electrophoresis (large\\nprotein molecules are suspended in a gel and separated\\nfrom one another by running an electric current\\nthrough the gel).

Since the virus\\nis continually generating new variants, PCR testing\\ncould yield a false negative in patients with these\\nnew variants.

The viral\\nload test is based on PCR techniques and supple-\\nments the CD4+ cell count tests.\\nWestern blot— A technique developed in 1979 that\\nis used to confirm ELISA results. HIV antigen is pur-\\nified by electrophoresis and attached by blotting to a\\nnylon or nitrocellulose filter. The patient’s serum is\\nreacted against the filter, followed by treatment with\\ndeveloping chemicals that allow HIV antibody to\\nshow up as a colored patch or blot.

Other tests have been in\\ndevelopment that would allow patients to monitor\\ntheir own therapy in the home without sending out\\nfor results.\\nPrognostic tests\\nBlood tests to evaluate patients already diagnosed\\nwith HIV infection are as important as the diagnostic\\ntests. Because AIDS has a long latency period, some\\npersons may be infected with the virus for 10 years or\\nlonger before they develop symptoms of AIDS. These\\npatients are sometimes called antibody-positive\\nasymptomatic carriers. Prognostic tests also help\\ndrug researchers evaluate the usefulness of new medi-\\ncations in treating AIDS.\\nBLOOD CELL COUNTS. Doctors can measure the\\nnumber or proportion of certain types of cells in an\\nAIDS patient’s blood to see whether and how rapidly\\nthe disease is progressing, or whether certain treat-\\nments are helping the patient. These cell count tests\\ninclude:\\n/C15Complete blood count (CBC). A CBC is a routine\\nanalysis performed on a sample of blood taken\\nfrom the patient’s vein with a needle and vacuum\\ntube. The measurements taken in a CBC include a\\nwhite blood cell count (WBC), a red blood cell count\\n(RBC), the red cell distribution width, thehematocrit\\n(ratio of the volume of the red blood cells to the\\nblood volume), and the amount of hemoglobin (the\\nblood protein that carries oxygen). Although CBCs\\nare used on more than just AIDS patients, they can\\nhelp the doctor determine if an AIDS patient has an\\nadvanced form of the disease. Specific AIDS-related\\nsigns in a CBC include a low hematocrit, a sharp\\ndecrease in the number of blood platelets, and a\\nlow level of a certain type of white blood cell called\\nneutrophils.\\n/C15Absolute CD4+ lymphocytes. A lymphocyte is a\\ntype of white blood cell that is important in the\\nformation of an immune response. Because HIV\\ntargets CD4+ lymphocytes, their number in the\\npatient’s blood can be used to track the course of\\nthe infection. This blood cell count is considered the\\nmost accurate indicator for the presence of an oppor-\\ntunistic infection in an AIDS patient. The absolute\\nCD4+ lymphocyte count is obtained by multiplying\\nthe patient’s white blood cell count (WBC) by the\\npercentage of lymphocytes among the white blood\\ncells, and multiplying the result by the percentage\\nof lymphocytes bearing the CD4+ marker. An abso-\\nlute count below 200-300 CD+4 lymphocytes\\nin 1 cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood indicates that\\nthe patient is vulnerable to some opportunistic\\ninfections.\\n/C15CD4+ lymphocyte percentage. Some doctors think\\nthat this is a more accurate test than the absolute\\ncount because the percentage does not depend on a\\nmanual calculation of the number of types of differ-\\nent white blood cells. A white blood cell count that is\\nbroken down into categories in this way is called a\\nWBC differential.\\nIt is important for doctors treating AIDS patients\\nto measure the lymphocyte count on a regular basis.\\nExperts consulted by the United States Public Health\\nService recommend the following frequency of serum\\ntesting based on the patient’s CD4+ level:\\n/C15CD4+ count more than 600 cells/mm3: Every six\\nmonths.\\n/C15CD4+ count between 200-600 cells/mm3: Every\\nthree months.\\n/C15CD4+ count less than 200 cells/mm3: Every three\\nmonths.\\nWhen the CD4+ count falls below 200 cells/mm3,\\nthe doctor will put the patient on a medication regi-\\nmen to protect him or her against opportunistic\\ninfections.\\nHIV VIRAL LOAD TESTS. Another type of blood test\\nfor monitoring AIDS patients is the viral load test. It\\nsupplements the CD4+ count, which can tell the doc-\\ntor the extent of the patient’s loss of immune function,\\nbut not the speed of HIV replication in the body. The\\nviral load test is based on PCR techniques and can\\nmeasure the number of copies of HIV nucleic acids.\\nSuccessive test results for a given patient’s viral load\\nare calculated on a base 10 logarithmic scale.\\nORAL HIV TESTS.

Researchers constantly work on\\nmore rapid tests for HIV that can be done in physician\\noffices or by less skilled people and more convenient\\nlocations in developing countries. A finger-stick test\\nthat can be read quickly from a whole blood sample\\nhad shown promising results in the fall of 2003.\\n92 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAIDS tests'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 122, 'page_label': '123'}, page_content='Another test, called the VScan test kit, requires no\\nrefrigeration or electricity and can safely be stored at\\nroom temperature.

Beta-microglo-\\nbulin is a protein found on the surface of all human\\ncells with a nucleus. It is released into the blood when a\\ncell dies. Although rising blood levels of/C122M are found\\nin patients withcancer and other serious diseases, a\\nrising /C122M blood level can be used to measure the\\nprogression of AIDS.\\nP24 ANTIGEN CAPTURE ASSAY. Found in the viral\\ncore of HIV, p24 is a protein that can be measured by\\nthe ELISA technique. Doctors can use p24 assays to\\nmeasure the antiviral activity of the patient’s medica-\\ntions. In addition, the p24 assay is sometimes useful\\nin detecting HIV infection before seroconversion.\\nHowever, p24 is consistently present in only 25% of\\npersons infected with HIV.\\nGENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TEST. Genotypic\\ntesting can help determine whether specific gene\\nmutations, common in people with HIV, are causing\\ndrug resistance and drug failure. The test looks for\\nspecific genetic mutations within the virus that are\\nknown to cause resistance to certain drugs used in\\nHIV treatment. For example the drug 3TC, also\\nknown as lamivudine (Epivir), is not effective against\\nstrains of HIV that have a mutation at a particular\\nposition on the reverse transcriptase protein—amino\\nacid 184—known as M184V (M!V, methionine to\\nvaline). So if the genotypic resistance test shows a\\nmutation at position M184V, it is likely the person\\nis resistant to 3TC and not likely to respond to 3TC\\ntreatment. Genotypic tests are only effective if the\\nperson is already taking antiviral medication and if\\nthe viral load is greater than 1,000 copies per milliliter\\n(mL) of blood. The cost of the test, usually between\\n$300 and $500, is usually now covered by many insur-\\nance plans.\\nPHENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TESTING.\\nPhenotypic testing directly measures the sensitivity of\\na patient’s HIV to particular drugs and drug combina-\\ntions. To do this, it measures the concentration of a\\ndrug required to inhibit viral replication in the test\\ntube. This is the same method used by researchers to\\ndetermine whether a drug might be effective against\\nHIV before using it in human clinical trials.\\nPhenotypic testing is a more direct measurement of\\nresistance than genotypic testing. Also, unlike genoty-\\npic testing, phenotypic testing does not require a high\\nviral load but it is recommended that persons already\\nbe takingantiretroviral drugs. The cost is between $700\\nand $900 and is now covered by many insurance plans.\\nAIDS serology in children\\nChildren born to HIV-infected mothers may\\nacquire the infection through the mother’s placenta\\nor during the birth process. Public health experts\\nrecommend the testing and monitoring of all children\\nborn to mothers with HIV. Diagnostic testing in chil-\\ndren older than 18 months is similar to adult testing,\\nwith ELISA screening confirmed by Western blot.\\nYounger infants can be diagnosed by direct culture\\nof the HIV virus, PCR testing, and p24 antigen testing.\\nThese techniques allow a pediatrician to identify 50%\\nof infected children at or near birth, and 95% of cases\\nin infants three to six months of age.\\nPreparation\\nPreparation and aftercare are important parts of\\nAIDS diagnostic testing. Doctors are now advised to\\ntake the patient’s emotional, social, economic, and\\nother circumstances into account and to provide coun-\\nseling before and after testing. Patients are generally\\nbetter able to cope with the results if the doctor has\\nspent some time with them before the blood test\\nexplaining the basic facts about HIV infection and\\ntesting. Many doctors now offer this type of informa-\\ntional counseling before performing the tests.\\nAftercare\\nIf the test results indicate that the patient is HIV-\\npositive, he or she will need counseling, information,\\nreferral for treatment, and support. Doctors can either\\ncounsel the patient themselves or invite an experienced\\nHIV counselor to discuss the results of the blood tests\\nwith the patient. They also will assess the patient’s\\nemotional and psychological status, including the pos-\\nsibility of violent behavior and the availability of a\\nsupport network.\\nRisks\\nThe risks of AIDS testing are primarily related to\\ndisclosure of the patient’s HIV status rather than to\\nany physical risks connected with blood testing.

However, other\\ntests, such as the levels of the MB fraction of creatine\\nkinase should indicate whether the abnormal test\\nlevels are because of muscle or liver damage.\\nDescription\\nThe alanine aminotransferase test (ALT) can\\nreveal liver damage. It is probably the most specific\\ntest for liver damage. However, the severity of the liver\\ndamage is not necessarily shown by the ALT test, since\\nthe amount of dead liver tissue does not correspond to\\nhigher ALT levels. Also, patients with normal, or\\ndeclining, ALT levels may experience serious liver\\ndamage without an increase in ALT.\\nNevertheless, ALT is widely used, and useful,\\nbecause ALT levels are elevated in most patients with\\nliver disease. Although ALT levels do not necessarily\\nindicate the severity of the damage to the liver, they\\nmay indicate how much of the liver has been damaged.\\nALT levels, when compared to the levels of a similar\\nenzyme, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), may pro-\\nvide important clues to the nature of the liver disease.\\nFor example, within a certain range of values, a ratio\\nof 2:1 or greater for AST: ALT might indicate that a\\npatient suffers from alcoholic liver disease.

Zuck, PhD\\nAlbers-Scho¨nberg disease see Osteopetroses\\nAlbinism\\nDefinition\\nAlbinism is an inherited condition present at\\nbirth, characterized by a lack of pigment that normally\\ngives color to the skin, hair, and eyes. Many types of\\nalbinism exist, all of which involve lack of pigment in\\nvarying degrees. The condition, which is found in all\\nraces, may be accompanied by eye problems and may\\nlead to skincancer later in life.\\nDescription\\nAlbinism is a rare disorder found in fewer than\\nfive people per 100,000 in the United States and\\nEurope. Other parts of the world have a much higher\\nrate; for example, albinism is found in about 20 out of\\nevery 100,000 people in southern Nigeria.\\nThere are 10 types of the most common form of the\\ncondition, known as ‘‘oculocutaneous albinism,’’ which\\naffects the eyes, hair, and skin. In its most severe form,\\nhair and skin remain pure white throughout life. People\\nwith a less severe form are born with white hair and skin,\\nwhich turn slightly darker as they age. Everyone with\\noculocutaneous albinism experiences abnormal flicker-\\ning eye movements (nystagmus) and sensitivity to bright\\nlight. There may be other eye problems as well, includ-\\ning poor vision and crossed or ‘‘lazy’’ eyes (strabismus).\\nThe second most common type of the condition is\\nknown as ‘‘ocular’’ albinism, in which only the eyes\\nlack color; skin and hair are normal. There are five\\nforms of ocular albinism; some types cause more pro-\\nblems–especially eye problems–than others.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nEvery cell in the body contains a matched pair of\\ngenes, one inherited from each parent. These genes act\\nas a sort of ‘‘blueprint’’ that guides the development of\\na fetus.\\nAlbinism is an inherited problem caused by a flaw\\nin one or more of the genes that are responsible for\\ndirecting the eyes and skin to make melanin (pigment).\\nAs a result, little or no pigment is made, and the child’s\\nskin, eyes and hair may be colorless.\\nIn most types of albinism, a recessive trait, the\\nchild inherits flawed genes for making melanin from\\nboth parents. Because the task of making melanin is\\ncomplex, there are many different types of albinism,\\ninvolving a number of different genes.\\nIt’s also possible to inherit one normal gene and\\none albinism gene. In this case, the one normal gene\\nprovides enough information in its cellular blueprint\\nto make some pigment, and the child will have normal\\nskin and eye color. They ‘‘carry’’ one gene for albin-\\nism. About one in 70 people are albinism carriers, with\\none flawed gene but no symptoms; they have a 50%\\nchance of passing the albinism gene to their child.\\nHowever, if both parents are carriers with one flawed\\ngene each, they have a 1 in 4 chance of passing on both\\ncopies of the flawed gene to the child, who will have\\nalbinism. (There is also a type of ocular albinism that\\nis carried on the X chromosome and occurs almost\\nexclusively in males because they have only one X\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 95\\nAlbinism'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 125, 'page_label': '126'}, page_content='chromosome and, therefore, no other gene for the trait\\nto override the flawed one.)\\nSymptoms of albinism can involve the skin, hair,\\nand eyes. The skin, because it contains little pigment,\\nappears very light, as does the hair.\\nAlthough people with albinism may experience a\\nvariety of eye problems, one of the myths about albin-\\nism is that it causes people to have pink or red eyes. In\\nfact, people with albinism can have irises varying from\\nlight gray or blue to brown. (The iris is the colored\\nportion of the eye that controls the size of the pupil,\\nthe opening that lets light into the eye.) If people with\\nalbinism seem to have reddish eyes, it’s because light is\\nbeing reflected from the back of the eye (retina) in\\nmuch the same way as happens when people are\\nphotographed with an electronic flash.\\nPeople with albinism may have one or more of the\\nfollowing eye problems:\\n/C15They may be very far-sighted or near-sighted, and\\nmay have other defects in the curvature of the lens of\\nthe eye (astigmatism) that cause images to appear\\nunfocused.\\n/C15They may have a constant, involuntary movement of\\nthe eyeball called nystagmus.\\n/C15They may have problems in coordinating the eyes in\\nfixing and tracking objects (strabismus), which may\\nlead to an appearance of having ‘‘crossed eyes’’ at\\ntimes. Strabismus may cause some problems with\\ndepth perception, especially at close distances.\\n/C15They may be very sensitive to light (photophobia)\\nbecause their irises allow ‘‘stray’’ light to enter their\\neyes. It’s a common misconception that people with\\nalbinism shouldn’t go out on sunny days, but wear-\\ning sunglasses can make it possible to go outside\\nquite comfortably.\\nA man with albinism stands with his normally pigmented father.

The hair\\nconverts tyrosine with the help of a substance called\\n‘‘tyrosinase.’’ In some types of albinism, tyrosinase\\ndoesn’t do its job, and melanin production breaks\\ndown.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no treatment that can replace the lack of\\nmelanin that causes the symptoms of albinism.\\nDoctors can only treat, not cure, the eye problems\\nthat often accompany the lack of skin color.

Depending on\\nwhich nerve and muscle pathways are involved,\\nalcohol can have far-reaching effects on different\\nparts of the brain, peripheral nerves, and muscles,\\nwith symptoms of memory loss, incoordination,\\nseizures, weakness, and sensory deficits. These differ-\\nent effects can be grouped into three main categories:\\n(1) intoxication due to the acute effects of ethanol, (2)\\nwithdrawal syndrome from suddenly stopping drink-\\ning, and (3) disorders related to long-term or chronic\\nalcohol abuse. Alcohol-related neurologic disease\\nincludes Wernicke-Korsakoff disease, alcoholic\\ncerebellar degeneration, alcoholic myopathy, alco-\\nholic neuropathy, alcohol withdrawal syndrome\\nwith seizures anddelirium tremens, andfetal alcohol\\nsyndrome.\\nDescription\\nAcute excess intake of alcohol can cause drunken-\\nness (intoxication) or evendeath, and chronic or long-\\nterm abuse leads to potentially irreversible damage to\\nvirtually any level of the nervous system.

The fatal dose varies widely\\nbecause people who drink heavily develop a toler-\\nance to the effects of alcohol with repeated use.

Fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading cause\\nof mental retardationand many physicians warn that\\nthere is no safe level of alcohol for a pregnant mother\\nto consume.\\nAlcoholic myopathy, or weakness secondary to\\nbreakdown of muscle tissue, is also known as alcoholic\\nrhabdomyolysis or alcoholic myoglobinuria. Males\\nare affected by acute (sudden onset) alcoholic myopa-\\nthy four times as often as females. Breakdown of\\nmuscle tissue (myonecrosis), can come on suddenly\\nduring binge drinking or in the first days of alcohol\\nwithdrawal. In its mildest form, this breakdown may\\ncause no noticeable symptoms, but may be detected by\\na temporary elevation in blood levels of an enzyme\\nfound predominantly in muscle, the MM fraction of\\ncreatine kinase.\\nThe severe form of acute alcoholic myopathy is\\nassociated with the sudden onset of musclepain, swel-\\nling, and weakness; a reddish tinge in the urine caused\\nby myoglobin, a breakdown product of muscle\\nexcreted in the urine; and a rapid rise in muscle\\nenzymes in the blood. Symptoms usually worsen over\\nhours to a few days, and then improve over the next\\nweek to 10 days as the patient is withdrawn from\\nalcohol. Muscle symptoms are usually generalized,\\nbut pain and swelling may selectively involve the\\ncalves or other muscle groups. The muscle breakdown\\nof acute alcoholic myopathy may be worsened by\\ncrush injuries, which may occur when people drink\\nso much that they compress a muscle group with\\ntheir body weight for a long time without moving, or\\nby withdrawal seizures with generalized muscle\\nactivity.\\nIn patients who abuse alcohol over many years,\\nchronic alcoholic myopathy may develop. Males and\\nfemales are equally affected. Symptoms include pain-\\nless weakness of the limb muscles closest to the trunk\\nand the girdle muscles, including the thighs, hips,\\nshoulders, and upper arms. This weakness develops\\ngradually, over weeks or months, without symptoms\\nof acute muscle injury. Muscle atrophy, or decreased\\nbulk, may be striking. The nerves of the extremities\\nmay also begin to break down, a condition known as\\nalcoholicperipheral neuropathy, which can add to the\\nperson’s difficulty in moving.\\nThe way in which alcohol destroys muscle tissue is\\nstill not well understood. Proposed mechanisms\\ninclude muscle membrane changes affecting the trans-\\nport of calcium, potassium, or other minerals;\\nimpaired muscle energy metabolism; and impaired\\nprotein synthesis. Alcohol is metabolized or broken\\ndown primarily by the liver, with a series of chemical\\nreactions in which ethanol is converted to acetate.\\nAcetate is metabolized by skeletal muscle, and alco-\\nhol-related changes in liver function may affect skele-\\ntal muscle metabolism, decreasing the amount of\\nblood sugar available to muscles during prolonged\\nactivity. Because not enough sugar is available to sup-\\nply needed energy, muscle protein may be broken\\ndown as an alternate energy source. However, toxic\\neffects on muscle may be a direct result of alcohol itself\\nrather than of its breakdown products.\\nAlthough alcoholic peripheral neuropathy may\\ncontribute to muscle weakness and atrophy by injur-\\ning the motor nerves controlling muscle movement,\\nalcoholic neuropathy more commonly affects sensory\\nfibers. Injury to these fibers can causetingling or burn-\\ning pain in the feet, which may be severe enough to\\ninterfere with walking. As the condition worsens, pain\\ndecreases butnumbness increases.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of alcohol-related neurologic dis-\\nease depends largely on finding characteristic symp-\\ntoms and signs in patients who abuse alcohol.

These disorders involve\\nrepeated life problems that can be directly attributed\\nto the use of alcohol. Both disorders can have serious\\nconsequences, affecting an individual’s health and per-\\nsonal life, as well as having an impact on society at large.\\nDescription\\nThe effects of alcoholism are far reaching.\\nAlcohol affects every body system, causing a wide\\nrange of health problems. Problems include poor\\nnutrition, memory disorders, difficulty with balance\\nand walking, liver disease (including cirrhosis and\\nhepatitis), high blood pressure, muscle weakness\\n(including the heart), heart rhythm disturbances,\\nanemia, clotting disorders, decreased immunity to\\ninfections, gastrointestinal inflammation and irrita-\\ntion, acute and chronic problems with the pancreas,\\nlow blood sugar, high blood fat content, interference\\nwith reproductive fertility, and weakened bones.\\nOn a personal level, alcoholism results in marital\\nand other relationship difficulties, depression, unem-\\nployment, child abuse, and general family dysfunction.\\nAlcoholism causes or contributes to a variety of\\nsevere social problems including homelessness, mur-\\nder,suicide, injury, and violent crime. Alcohol is a\\ncontributing factor in at least 50% of all deaths from\\nmotor vehicle accidents. In fact, about 100,000 deaths\\noccur each year due to the effects of alcohol, of which\\n50% are due to injuries of some sort. According to a\\nspecial report prepared for the U.S. Congress by the\\nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,\\nthe impact of alcohol on society, including violence,\\ntraffic accidents, lost work productivity, and prema-\\nture death, costs our nation an estimated $185 billion\\nannually. In addition, it is estimated that approxi-\\nmately one in four children (19 million children or\\n29% of children up to 17 years of age) is exposed at\\nsome time to familial alcohol abuse, alcohol depen-\\ndence, or both. Furthermore, it has been estimated\\nthat approximately 18% of adults experience an\\nepisode of alcohol abuse or dependence a some time\\nduring their lives.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are probably a number of factors that work\\ntogether to cause a person to become an alcoholic.\\nRecent genetic studies have demonstrated that close\\nrelatives of an alcoholic are four times more likely to\\nbecome alcoholics themselves. Furthermore, this risk\\nholds true even for children who were adopted away\\nfrom their biological families at birth and raised in a\\nnon-alcoholic adoptive family, with no knowledge of\\ntheir biological family’s difficulties with alcohol. More\\nresearch is being conducted to determine if genetic\\nfactors could account for differences in alcohol meta-\\nbolism that may increase the risk of an individual\\nbecoming an alcoholic.\\nThe symptoms of alcoholism can be broken down\\ninto two major categories: symptoms of acute alcohol\\nuse and symptoms of long-term alcohol use.\\nImmediate (acute) effects of alcohol use\\nAlcohol exerts a depressive effect on the brain. The\\nblood-brain barrier does not prevent alcohol from\\nentering the brain, so the brain alcohol level will quickly\\nbecome equivalent to the blood alcohol level. Alcohol’s\\ndepressive effects result in difficulty walking, poor bal-\\nance, slurring of speech, and generally poor coordina-\\ntion (accounting in part for the increased likelihood of\\ninjury). The affected person also may have impairment\\nof peripheral vision. At higher alcohol levels, a person’s\\nbreathing and heart rates will be slowed, andvomiting\\nmay occur (with a high risk of the vomit being breathed\\ninto the lungs, resulting in severe problems, including\\nthe possibility ofpneumonia). Still higher alcohol levels\\nmay result in coma and death.\\nEffects of long-term (chronic) alcoholism\\nLong-term use of alcohol affects virtually every\\norgan system of the body:\\nSymptoms Of Co-Alcohol Dependence\\nPsychological distress manifested in symptoms such as anxiety, aggression,\\nanorexia nervosa, bulimia, depression,insomnia, hyperactivity, and suicidal\\ntendency\\nPsychosomatic illness (ailments that have no biological basis and clear up\\nafter the co-alcoholism clears up)\\nFamily violence or neglect\\nAlcoholism or other drug abuse\\n102 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAlcoholism'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 132, 'page_label': '133'}, page_content='/C15Nervous system. An estimated 30-40% of all men in\\ntheir teens and twenties have experienced alcoholic\\nblackout, which occurs when drinking a large quan-\\ntity of alcohol results in the loss of memory of the\\ntime surrounding the episode of drinking. Alcohol is\\nwell-known to cause sleep disturbances, so that over-\\nall sleep quality is affected. Numbness andtingling\\nmay occur in the arms and legs. Two syndromes,\\nwhich can occur together or separately, are known\\nas Wernicke’s and Korsakoff’s syndromes. Both are\\ndue to the low thiamine (a form of vitamin B\\ncomplex) levels found in alcoholics. Wernicke’s\\nsyndrome results in disordered eye movements, very\\npoor balance and difficulty walking, while\\nKorsakoff’s syndromeseverely affects one’s memory,\\npreventing new learning from taking place.\\n/C15Gastrointestinal system. Alcohol causes loosening of\\nthe muscular ring that prevents the stomach’s con-\\ntents from re-entering the esophagus. Therefore, the\\nacid from the stomach flows backward into the eso-\\nphagus, burning those tissues, and causingpain and\\nbleeding. Inflammation of the stomach also can\\nresult in bleeding and pain, and decreased desire to\\neat. A major cause of severe, uncontrollable bleeding\\n(hemorrhage) in an alcoholic is the development\\nof enlarged (dilated) blood vessels within the\\nesophagus, which are called esophageal varices.\\nThese varices actually are developed in response to\\nliver disease, and are extremely prone to bursting and\\nhemorrhaging.Diarrhea is a common symptom, due\\nto alcohol’s effect on the pancreas. In addition,\\ninflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) is a ser-\\nious and painful problem in alcoholics. Throughout\\nthe intestinal tract, alcohol interferes with the\\nabsorption of nutrients, creating a malnourished\\nstate. Because alcohol is broken down (metabolized)\\nwithin the liver, the organ is severely affected by\\nconstant levels of alcohol. Alcohol interferes with a\\nnumber of important chemical processes that also\\noccur in the liver. The liver begins to enlarge and fill\\nwith fat (fatty liver), fibrous scar tissue interferes with\\nthe liver’s normal structure and function (cirrhosis),\\nand the liver may become inflamed (hepatitis).\\n/C15Blood. Alcohol can cause changes to all the types of\\nblood cells. Red blood cells become abnormally\\nlarge. White blood cells (important for fighting infec-\\ntions) decrease in number, resulting in a weakened\\nimmune system. This places alcoholics at increased\\nrisk for infections, and is thought to account in part\\nfor the increased risk of cancer faced by alcoholics\\n(10 times the risk for nonalcoholics). Platelets and\\nblood clotting factors are affected, causing an\\nincreased risk of bleeding.\\n/C15Heart. Small amounts of alcohol cause a drop in\\nblood pressure, but with increased use, alcohol\\nbegins to increase blood pressure into a dangerous\\nrange. High levels of fats circulating in the blood-\\nstream increase the risk of heart disease. Heavy\\ndrinking results in an increase in heart size, weaken-\\ning of the heart muscle, abnormal heart rhythms, a\\nrisk ofblood clotsforming within the chambers of the\\nheart, and a greatly increased risk of stroke (due to a\\nblood clot from the heart entering the circulatory\\nsystem, going to the brain, and blocking a brain\\nblood vessel).\\n/C15Reproductive system. Heavy drinking has a negative\\neffect on fertility in both men and women, by\\ndecreasing testicle and ovary size, and interfering\\nwith both sperm and egg production. Whenpreg-\\nnancy is achieved in an alcoholic woman, the baby\\nhas a great risk of being born withfetal alcohol\\nsyndrome, which causes distinctive facial defects,\\nlowered IQ, and behavioral problems.\\nDiagnosis\\nTwo different types of alcohol-related difficulties\\nhave been identified.

A clinician may begin to be\\nsuspicious when a patient suffers repeated injuries or\\nbegins to experience medical problems related to\\nthe use of alcohol. In fact, some estimates suggest\\nthat about 20% of a physician’s patients will be\\nalcoholics.\\nDiagnosis is aided by administering specific psy-\\nchological assessments that try to determine what\\naspects of a person’s life may be affected by his or\\nher use of alcohol. Determining the exact quantity of\\nalcohol that a person drinks is of much less impor-\\ntance than determining how his or her drinking affects\\nrelationships, jobs, educational goals, and family life.\\nIn fact, because the metabolism (how the body breaks\\ndown and processes) of alcohol is so individual, the\\nquantity of alcohol consumed is not part of the criteria\\nlist for diagnosing either alcohol dependence or alco-\\nhol abuse.\\nOne simple tool for beginning the diagnosis of\\nalcoholism is called the CAGE questionnaire. It con-\\nsists of four questions, with the first letters of each key\\nword spelling out the word CAGE:\\n/C15Have you ever tried toCut down on your drinking?\\n/C15Have you ever beenAnnoyed by anyone’s comments\\nabout your drinking?\\n/C15Have you ever feltGuilty about your drinking?\\n/C15Do you ever need anEye-opener (a morning drink of\\nalcohol) to start the day)?\\nOther, longer lists of questions exist to help deter-\\nmine the severity and effects of a person’s alcohol use.\\nGiven the recent research pointing to a genetic basis\\nfor alcoholism, it is important to ascertain whether\\nanyone else in the person’s family has ever suffered\\nfrom alcoholism.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of alcoholism has two parts. The first\\nstep in the treatment of alcoholism, called detoxifica-\\ntion, involves helping the person stop drinking and\\nridding his or her body of the harmful (toxic) effects\\nof alcohol. Because the person’s body has become\\naccustomed to alcohol, the person will need to be\\nsupported through withdrawal. Withdrawal will be\\ndifferent for different patients, depending on the sever-\\nity of the alcoholism, as measured by the quantity of\\nalcohol ingested daily and the length of time the\\npatient has been an alcoholic. Withdrawal symptoms\\ncan range from mild to life-threatening. Mild with-\\ndrawal symptoms includenausea, achiness, diarrhea,\\ndifficulty sleeping, sweatiness,anxiety, and trembling.\\nThis phase is usually over in about three to five days.\\nMore severe effects of withdrawal can includehalluci-\\nnations (in which a patient sees, hears, or feels some-\\nthing that is not actually real), seizures, an unbearable\\ncraving for more alcohol, confusion,fever, fast heart\\nrate, high blood pressure, anddelirium (a fluctuating\\nlevel of consciousness). Patients at highest risk for the\\nmost severe symptoms of withdrawal (referred to as\\ndelirium tremens) are those with other medical\\nproblems, includingmalnutrition, liver disease,o r\\nWernicke’s syndrome. Delirium tremens usually\\nbegin about three to five days after the patient’s last\\ndrink, progressing from the more mild symptoms to\\nthe more severe, and may last a number of days.\\nPatients going through only mild withdrawal are\\nsimply monitored carefully to make sure that more\\nsevere symptoms do not develop. No medications are\\nnecessary, however. Treatment of a patient suffering\\nthe more severe effects of withdrawal may require the\\nuse of sedative medications to relieve the discomfort of\\nwithdrawal and to avoid the potentially life-threaten-\\ning complications of high blood pressure, fast heart\\nrate, and seizures. Drugs called benzodiazapines are\\nhelpful in those patients suffering from hallucinations.\\nBecause of the patient’s nausea, fluids may need to be\\ngiven through a vein (intravenously), along with some\\nnecessary sugars and salts. It is crucial that thiamine\\nbe included in the fluids, because thiamine is usually\\nquite low in alcoholic patients, and deficiency of thia-\\nmine is responsible for the Wernicke-Korsakoff\\nsyndrome.\\n104 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAlcoholism'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 134, 'page_label': '135'}, page_content='After cessation of drinking has been accom-\\nplished, the next steps involve helping the patient\\navoid ever taking another drink. This phase of treat-\\nment is referred to asrehabilitation. The best programs\\nincorporate the family into the therapy, because the\\nfamily has undoubtedly been severely affected by the\\npatient’s drinking. Some therapists believe that family\\nmembers, in an effort to deal with their loved one’s\\ndrinking problem, sometimes develop patterns of\\nbehavior that accidentally support or ‘‘enable’’ the\\npatient’s drinking. This situation is referred to as\\n‘‘co-dependence,’’ and must be addressed in order to\\nsuccessfully treat a person’s alcoholism.\\nSessions led by peers, where recovering alcoholics\\nmeet regularly and provide support for each other’s\\nrecoveries, are considered among the best methods of\\npreventing a return to drinking (relapse). Perhaps the\\nmost well-known such group is called Alcoholics\\nAnonymous, which uses a ‘‘12-step’’ model to help\\npeople avoid drinking. These steps involve recognizing\\nthe destructive power that alcohol has held over\\nthe alcoholic’s life, looking to a higher power for\\nhelp in overcoming the problem, and reflecting on\\nthe ways in which the use of alcohol has hurt others\\nand, if possible, making amends to those people.\\nAccording to a recent study reported by the American\\nPsychological Association (APA), anyone, regardless\\nof his or her religious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs,\\ncan benefit from participation in 12-step programs\\nsuch as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) orNarcotics\\nAnonymous (NA). The number of visits to 12-step\\nself-help groups exceeds the number of visits to all\\nmental health professionals combined.\\nThere are also medications that may help an alco-\\nholic avoid returning to drinking. These have been\\nused with variable success. Disulfiram (Antabuse)\\nis a drug which, when mixed with alcohol, causes\\nunpleasant reactions including nausea, vomiting,\\ndiarrhea, and trembling. Naltrexone, along with a\\nsimilar compound, Nalmefene, can be helpful in limit-\\ning the effects of a relapse. Acamprosate is helpful in\\npreventing relapse. None of these medications would\\nbe helpful unless the patient was also willing to work\\nvery hard to change his or her behavior. In 2004, a new\\ncompound was discovered that blocks actions of\\nchemicals in the brain that may lead to relapses.\\nClinical tests were still underway, but development of\\nsuch a drug could have great potential in the medical\\nmanagement of alcoholism. Another study that year\\nfound that topiramate (Topamax), an antiseizure\\nmedication, was effective in treating alcohol depen-\\ndence in 150 participants in a clinical trial. The authors\\ncalled for further study of this possible treatment.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments can be a helpful adjunct\\nfor the alcoholic patient, once the medical danger of\\nwithdrawal has passed. Because many alcoholics\\nhave very stressful lives (whether because of or lead-\\ning to the alcoholism is sometimes a matter of\\ndebate), many of the treatments for alcoholism\\ninvolve dealing with and relievingstress.T h e s e\\ninclude massage, meditation,a n dhypnotherapy.T h e\\nmalnutrition of long-term alcohol use is addressed by\\nnutrition-oriented practitioners with careful atten-\\ntion to a healthy diet and the use of nutritional sup-\\nplements such asvitamins A, B complex, and C, as\\nwell as certain fatty acids, amino acids, zinc, magne-\\nsium, and selenium. Herbal treatments include milk\\nthistle (Silybum marianum ), which is thought to pro-\\ntect the liver against damage. Other herbs are thought\\nto be helpful for the patient suffering through with-\\ndrawal. Some of these include lavender (Lavandula\\nofficinalis), skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora ), chamo-\\nmile ( Matricaria recutita ), peppermint ( Mentha\\npiperita) yarrow (Achillea millefolium ), and valerian\\n(Valeriana officinalis ). Acupuncture is believed to\\nboth decrease withdrawal symptoms and to help\\nimprove a patient’s chances for continued recovery\\nfrom alcoholism.\\nPrognosis\\nRecovery from alcoholism is a life-long process.\\nIn fact, people who have suffered from alcoholism are\\nencouraged to refer to themselves ever after as ‘‘a\\nrecovering alcoholic,’’ never a recovered alcoholic.\\nThis is because most researchers in the field believe\\nthat since the potential for alcoholism is still part of\\nthe individual’s biological and psychological makeup,\\none can never fully recover from alcoholism. The\\npotential for relapse (returning to illness) is always\\nthere, and must be acknowledged and respected.\\nStatistics suggest that, among middle-class alcoholics\\nin stable financial and family situations who have\\nundergone treatment, 60% or more can be successful\\nat an attempt to stop drinking for at least a year, and\\nmany for a lifetime.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention must begin at a relatively young age\\nsince the first instance of intoxication (drunkenness)\\nusually occurs during the teenage years.

Odle\\nALD see Adrenoleukodystrophy\\nAldolase test\\nDefinition\\nAldolase is an enzyme found throughout the\\nbody, particularly in muscles. Like all enzymes, it is\\nneeded to trigger specific chemical reactions. Aldolase\\nhelps muscle turn sugar into energy. Testing for aldo-\\nlase is done to diagnose and monitor skeletal muscle\\ndiseases.\\nPurpose\\nSkeletal muscle diseases increase the aldolase level\\nfound in a person’s blood. Skeletal muscles are those\\nmuscles attached to bones and whose contractions\\nmake those bones move. When the muscles are dis-\\neased or damaged, such as inmuscular dystrophy, the\\ncells deteriorate and break open. The contents of the\\ncells, including aldolase, spill into the bloodstream.\\nMeasuring the amount of aldolase in the blood indi-\\ncates the degree of muscle damage.\\nAs muscles continue to deteriorate, aldolase levels\\ndecrease and eventually fall below normal. Less mus-\\ncle means fewer cells and less aldolase.\\nMuscle weakness may be caused by neurologic as\\nwell as muscular problems. The measurement of\\naldolase levels can help pinpoint the cause. Aldolase\\nlevels will be normal where muscle weakness is caused\\nby neurological disease, such as poliomyelitis or\\nmultiple sclerosis, but aldolase levels will be elevated\\nin cases of muscular disease, such as muscular\\ndystrophy.\\nAldolase is also found in the liver and cardiac\\nmuscle of the heart. Damage or disease to these\\norgans, such as chronic hepatitis or aheart attack,\\nwill also increase aldolase levels in the blood, but to a\\nlesser degree.\\nDescription\\nAldolase is measured by mixing a person’s serum\\nwith a substance with which aldolase is known to\\ntrigger a reaction. The end product of this reaction is\\nmeasured, and, from that measurement, the amount of\\naldolase in the person’s serum is determined.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAldolase— An enzyme, found primarily in the mus-\\ncle, that helps convert sugar into energy.\\nEnzyme— A substance needed to trigger specific\\nchemical reactions.\\nNeurologic— Having to do with the nervous system.\\nSkeletal muscle— Muscle connected to, and neces-\\nsary for the movement of, bones.\\n106 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAldolase test'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 136, 'page_label': '137'}, page_content='The test is covered by insurance when medically\\nnecessary.

Nordenson\\nAldosterone assay\\nDefinition\\nThis test measures the levels of aldosterone, a\\nhormone produced by the outer part (cortex) of the\\ntwo adrenal glands, organs which sit one on top of\\neach of the kidneys. Aldosterone regulates the\\namounts of sodium and potassium in the blood. This\\nhelps maintain water balance and blood volume,\\nwhich, in turn, affects blood pressure.\\nPurpose\\nAldosterone measurement is useful in detecting a\\ncondition called aldosteronism, which is caused by\\nexcess secretion of the hormone from the adrenal\\nglands. There are two types of aldosteronism: primary\\nand secondary. Primary aldosteronism is most com-\\nmonly caused by an adrenal tumor, as in Conn’s\\nsyndrome. Idiopathic (of unknown cause)hyperaldos-\\nteronism is another type of primary aldosteronism.\\nSecondary aldosteronism is more common and may\\noccur with congestive heart failure,cirrhosis with fluid\\nin the abdominal cavity (ascites), certain kidney dis-\\neases, excess potassium, sodium-depleted diet, and\\ntoxemia ofpregnancy.\\nTo differentiate primary aldosteronism from sec-\\nondary aldosteronism, a plasma renin test should be\\nperformed at the same time as the aldosterone assay.\\nRenin, an enzyme produced in the kidneys, is high in\\nsecondary aldosteronism and low in primary\\naldosteronism.\\nDescription\\nAldosterone testing can be performed on a blood\\nsample or on a 24-hour urine specimen. Several fac-\\ntors, including diet, posture (upright or lying down),\\nand time of day that the sample is obtained can cause\\naldosterone levels to fluctuate. Blood samples are\\naffected by short-term fluctuations. A urine specimen\\ncollected over an entire 24-hour period lessens the\\neffects of those interfering factors and provides a\\nmore reliable aldosterone measurement.\\nPreparation\\nFasting is not required for either the blood sample\\nor urine collection, but the patient should maintain a\\nnormal sodium diet (approximately 0.1 oz [3g]/day)\\nfor at least two weeks before either test.

Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal\\nantibody that selectively binds to CD52, a protein\\nfound on the surface of normal and malignant B and\\nT cells, that is used to reduce the numbers of circulat-\\ning malignant cells of patients who have B-cell chronic\\nlymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL).\\nPurpose\\nAlemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to\\ntreat B-CLL, one of the most prevalent forms of adult\\nchronic leukemia. It specifically binds CD52, a protein\\nfound on the surface of essentially all B and T cells of\\nthe immune system. By binding the CD52 protein on\\nthe malignant B cells, the antibody targets it for\\nremoval from the circulation. Scientists believe that\\nalemtuzumab triggers antibody-mediated lysis of the\\nB cells, a method that the immune system uses to\\neliminate foreign cells.\\nAlemtuzumab has been approved by the FDA for\\ntreatment of refractory B-CLL. For a patient’s disease\\nto be classified as refractory, both alkylating agents\\nand fludarabine treatment must have been tried and\\nfailed.

As\\nmost patients with B-CLL are in stage III or IV by the\\ntime both alkylating agents and fludarabine have been\\ntried, the experience with alemtuzumab treatment are\\nprimarily with those stages of the disease. In clinical\\ntrials, about 30% of patients had a partial response to\\nthe drug, with 2% of these being complete responses.\\nThis antibody has been tested with limited suc-\\ncess in the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma\\n(NHL) and for the preparation of patients with var-\\nious immune cell malignancies for bone marrow\\ntransplantation.

For alemtuzumab, the antigen is CD52, a\\nprotein found on the surface of normal and malignant\\nB and T cells as well as other cells of the immune and\\nmale reproductive systems. Alemtuzumab is a human-\\nized antibody, meaning that the regions that bind\\nCD52, located on the tips of the Y branches, are\\nderived from rat antibodies, but the rest of the anti-\\nbody is human sequence. The presence of the human\\nsequences helps to reduce the immune response by the\\npatient against the antibody itself, a problem seen\\nwhen complete mouse antibodies are used forcancer\\ntherapies. The human sequences also help to ensure\\nthat the various cell-destroying mechanisms of the\\nhuman immune system are properly triggered with\\nbinding of the antibody.\\nAlemtuzumab was approved in May of 2001 for the\\ntreatment of refractory B-CLL.

The recommended beginning dosage for B-CLL\\npatients is a daily dose of 3 mg of Campath adminis-\\ntered as a two-hour IV infusion. Once this amount is\\ntolerated, the dose is increased to 10 mg per day. After\\ntolerating this dose, it can be increased to 30 mg, admi-\\nnistered three days a week. Acetominophen and diphen-\\nhydramine hydrochoride are given thirty to sixty\\nminutes before the infusion to help reduce side effects.\\nAdditionally, patients generally receive anti-infec-\\ntive medication before treatment to help minimize the\\nserious opportunistic infections that can result from this\\ntreatment.

Nikolaas\\nTinbergen, in his 1973 Nobel lecture, hailed the ‘‘strik-\\ning improvements in such diverse things as high blood\\npressure, breathing, depth of sleep, overall cheerful-\\nness and mental alertness, resilience against outside\\npressures, and the refined skill of playing a musical\\ninstrument.’’ He went on to quote a list of other con-\\nditions helped by the Alexander technique: ‘‘rheuma-\\ntism, including various forms of arthritis, then\\nrespiratory troubles, and even potentially lethal\\nasthma; following in their wake, circulation defects,\\nwhich may lead to high blood pressure and also to\\nsome dangerous heart conditions; gastrointestinal dis-\\norders of many types, various gynecological condi-\\ntions, sexual failures, migraines and depressive states.’’\\nLiterature in the 1980s and 1990s went on to\\ninclude improvements in backpain, chronic pain, pos-\\ntural problems, repetitive strain injury, benefits during\\npregnancy and childbirth, help in applying physical\\ntherapy and rehabilitative exercises, improvements in\\nstrain caused by computer use, improvements in the\\nposture and performance of school children, and\\nimprovements in vocal and dramatic performance\\namong the benefits offered by the technique.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nFrederick Matthias Alexander was born in 1869 in\\nTasmania, Australia. He became an actor and\\nShakespearean reciter, and early in his career he\\nbegan to suffer from strain on his vocal chords. He\\nsought medical attention for chronic hoarseness, but\\nafter treatment with a recommended prescription and\\nextensive periods of rest, his problem persisted.\\nAlexander realized that his hoarseness began\\nabout an hour into a dramatic performance and\\nreasoned that it was something he did in the process\\nof reciting that caused him to lose his voice. Returning\\nto his medical doctor, Alexander told him of his\\nobservation. When the doctor admitted that he\\ndidn’t know what Alexander was doing to injure\\nhis vocal chords, Alexander decided to try and find\\nout for himself.\\n110 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAlexander technique'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 140, 'page_label': '141'}, page_content='Thus began a decade of self-observation and discov-\\nery. Using as many as three mirrors to observe himself in\\nthe act of reciting, normal speaking, and later standing,\\nwalking, and sitting, Alexander managed to improve\\nhis coordination and to overcome his vocal problems.\\nOne of his most startling discoveries was that in order to\\nchange the way he used his body he had to change the\\nway he was thinking, redirecting his thoughts in such a\\nway that he did not produce unnecessary tension\\nwhen he attempted speech or movement. After making\\nthis discovery at the end of the nineteenth century,\\nAlexander became a pioneerin body-mind medicine.\\nAt first, performers and dancers sought guidance\\nfrom Alexander to overcome physical complaints and\\nto improve the expression and spontaneity of their\\nperformances. Soon a great number of people sought\\nhelp from his teaching for a variety of physical and\\nmental disorders.\\nThe Alexander technique is primarily taught one-\\non-one in private lessons. Introductory workshops or\\nworkshops for special applications of the technique\\n(e.g.,workshops for musicians) are also common.\\nPrivate lessons range from a half-hour to an hour in\\nlength, and are taught in a series. The number of lessons\\nvaries according to the severity of the student’s difficul-\\nties with coordination or to the extent of the student’s\\ninterest in pursuing the improvements made possible by\\ncontinued study. The cost of lessons ranges from $40-80\\nper hour. Insurance coverage is not widely available,\\nbut discounts are available for participants in some\\ncomplementary care insurance plans. Pre-tax Flexible\\nSpending Accounts for health care cover Alexander\\ntechnique lessons if they are prescribed by a physician.\\nIn lessons teachers guide students through simple\\nmovements (while students are dressed in comfortable\\nclothing) and use their hands to help students identify\\nand stop destructive patterns of tension. Tensing\\narises from mental processes as well as physical, so\\ndiscussions of personal reactions or behavior are likely\\nto arise in the course of a lesson.\\nT h et e c h n i q u eh e l p ss t u d e n t sm o v ew i t he a s ea n d\\nimproved coordination. At the beginning of a move-\\nment (the lessons are a series of movements), most peo-\\nple pull back their heads, raise their shoulders toward\\ntheir ears, over-arch their lower backs, tighten their legs,\\nand otherwise produce excessive tension in their bodies.\\nAlexander referred to this as misuse of the body.\\nAt any point in a movement, proper use can be\\nestablished. If the neck muscles are not over-tensed,\\nthe head will carry slightly forward of the spine, simply\\nbecause it is heavier in the front. When the head is out\\nof balance in the forward direction, it sets off a series\\nof stretch reflexes in the extensor muscles of the back.\\nIt is skillful use of these reflexes, along with reflex\\nactivity in the feet and legs, the arms and hands, the\\nbreathing mechanism, and other parts of the body,\\nthat lessons in the technique aim to develop.\\nAlexander found that optimal functioning of the\\nbody was very hard to maintain, even for the short\\nperiod of time it took to complete a single movement.\\nPeople, especially adults, have very strong tension\\nhabits associated with movement. Chronic misuse of\\nthe muscles is common. It may be caused by slouching\\nin front of televisions or video monitors, too much\\nsitting or driving and too little walking, or by tension\\nassociated with past traumas and injuries. Stiffening\\nthe neck after awhiplash injury or favoring a broken or\\nsprained leg long after it has healed are examples of\\nhabitual tension caused by injury.\\nThe first thing a teacher of the Alexander tech-\\nnique does is to increase a student’s sensory awareness\\nof this excessive habitual tension, particularly that in\\nthe neck and spine. Next the student is taught to\\ninhibit the tension. If the student prepares to sit\\ndown, for example, he will tense his muscles in his\\nhabitual way. If he is asked to put aside the intention\\nto sit and instead to free his neck and allow less con-\\nstriction in his muscles, he can begin to change his\\ntense habitual response to sitting.\\nBy leaving the head resting on the spine in its\\nnatural free balance, by keeping eyes open and\\nfocused, not held in a tense stare, by allowing the\\nshoulders to release, the knees to unlock and the\\nback to lengthen and widen, a student greatly reduces\\nstrain. In Alexander lessons students learn to direct\\nthemselves this way in activity and become skilled in\\nfluid, coordinated movement.\\nKEY TERMS\\nDirection— Bringing about the free balance of the\\nhead on the spine and the resulting release of the\\nerector muscles of the back and legs which esta-\\nblish improved coordination.\\nHabit— Referring to the particular set of physical\\nand mental tensions present in any individual.\\nInhibition— Referring to the moment in an\\nAlexander lesson when the student refrains from\\nbeginning a movement in order to avoid tensing\\nof the muscles.\\nSensory awareness— Bringing attention to the sen-\\nsations of tension and/or release in the muscles.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 111\\nAlexander technique'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 141, 'page_label': '142'}, page_content='Precautions\\nSide effects\\nThe focus of the Alexander technique is educa-\\ntional.

No forceful treatment of soft tissue or\\nbony structure is attempted, so damage to tissues, even\\nin the case of errors in teaching, is unlikely.\\nAs students’ sensory awareness develops in the\\ncourse of Alexander lessons, they become more\\nacutely aware of chronic tension patterns.

These tumors are called\\ngerm cell tumors and includetesticular cancer and\\ncertain brain tumors.\\nAlkaline phosphatase from the intestine is\\nincreased in a person with inflammatory bowel dis-\\nease, such asulcerative colitis.\\nDescription\\nAlkaline phosphatase is measured by combining\\nthe person’s serum with specific substances with which\\nalkaline phosphatase is known to react. The end\\nproduct of this reaction is measured; and from that\\nmeasurement, the amount of alkaline phosphatase in\\nthe person’s serum is determined.\\nEach tissue–liver, bone, placenta, and intestine–\\nproduces a slightly different alkaline phosphatase.\\nThese variations are called isoenzymes. In the labora-\\ntory, alkaline phosphatase is measured as the total\\namount or the amount of each of the the four isoen-\\nzymes. The isoenzymes react differently to heat, cer-\\ntain chemicals, and other processes in the laboratory.\\nMethods to measure them separately are based on\\nthese differences.\\nThe test is covered by insurance when medically\\nnecessary. Results are usually available the next day.\\nPreparation\\nTo collect the 5-10 ml blood needed for this test, a\\nhealthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the person’s\\nupper arm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region,\\nand inserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum action\\ndraws the blood through the needle into an attached\\ntube. Collection of the sample takes only a few minutes.\\nA person being tested for alkaline phosphatase\\nshould not have anything to eat or drink, except\\nwater, for eight to ten hours before the test. Some\\npeople release alkaline phosphatase from the intestine\\ninto the bloodstream after eating. This will tempora-\\nrily increase the result of the test.\\nAftercare\\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\\nsite or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to\\nthe puncture site until the bleeding stops will reduce\\nbruising. Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve\\ndiscomfort.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results vary by age and by sex. They also\\nvary based on the laboratory and the method used.\\nAbnormal results\\nBone and liver disease increase alkaline phospha-\\ntase more than any other disease, up to five times the\\nnormal level. Irritable bowel disease, germ cell tumors,\\nand infections involving the liver, such as viral hepa-\\ntitis andinfectious mononucleosis, increase the enzyme\\nalso, but to a lesser degree. Healing bones, pregnancy,\\nand normal growth in children also increase levels.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nLehmann, Craig A., editor.Saunders Manual of Clinical\\nLaboratory Science. Philadelphia: W. B.

ABPA is a hyper-\\nsensitivity reaction that occurs in asthma patients who\\nare allergic to this specific fungus.\\nDescription\\nABPA is an allergic reaction to a species of\\nAspergillus called Aspergillus fumigatus .I ti ss o m e -\\ntimes grouped together with other lung disorders\\ncharacterized by eosinophilia–an abnormal increase\\nof a certain type of white blood cell in the blood–\\nunder the heading of eosinophilic pneumonia. These\\ndisorders are also called hypersensitivity lung\\ndiseases.\\nABPA appears to be increasing in frequency in the\\nUnited States, although the reasons for the increase\\nare not clear. The disorder is most likely to occur in\\nadult asthmatics aged 20-40. It affects males and\\nfemales equally.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nABPA develops when the patient breathes air\\ncontaining Aspergillus spores. These spores are\\nfound worldwide, especially around riverbanks,\\nmarshes, bogs, forests, and wherever there is wet or\\ndecaying vegetation. They are also found on wet\\npaint, construction materials, and in air condition-\\ning systems. ABPA is a nosocomial infection,\\nwhich means that a patient can get it in a hospital.\\nWhenAspergillus spores reach the bronchi, which\\nare the branches of the windpipe that lead into the\\nlungs, the bronchi react by contracting spasmodi-\\ncally. So the patient has difficulty breathing and\\nusually wheezes or coughs. Many patients with\\nABPA also run a low-grade fever and lose their\\nappetites.\\nComplications\\nPatients with ABPA sometimes cough up large\\namounts of blood, a condition that is calledhemopty-\\nsis. They may also develop a serious long-term form of\\nbronchiectasis, the formation of fibrous tissue in the\\nlungs. Bronchiectasis is a chronic bronchial disorder\\ncaused by repeated inflammation of the airway, and\\nmarked by the abnormal enlargement of, or damage\\nto, the bronchial walls. ABPA sometimes occurs as a\\ncomplication of cystic fibrosis.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAntifungal— A medicine used to treat infections\\ncaused by a fungus.\\nAntigen— A substance that stimulates the produc-\\ntion of antibodies.\\nBronchiectasis— A disorder of the bronchial tubes\\nmarked by abnormal stretching, enlargement, or\\ndestruction of the walls. Bronchiectasis is usually\\ncaused by recurrent inflammation of the airway\\nand is a diagnostic criterion of ABPA.\\nBronchodilator— A medicine used to open up the\\nbronchial tubes (air passages) of the lungs.\\nEosinophil— A type of white blood cell containing\\ngranules that can be stained by eosin (a chemical\\nthat produces a red stain).\\nEosinophilia— An abnormal increase in the number\\nof eosinophils in the blood.\\nHemoptysis— The coughing up of large amounts of\\nblood. Hemoptysis can occur as a complication of\\nABPA.\\nHypersensitivity— An excessive response by the\\nbody to a foreign substance.\\nImmunoglobulin E (IgE)— A type of protein in\\nblood plasma that acts as an antibody to activate\\nallergic reactions. About 50% of patients with aller-\\ngic disorders have increased IgE levels in their\\nblood serum.\\nNosocomial infection— An infection that can be\\nacquired in a hospital. ABPA is a nosocomial\\ninfection.\\nPrecipitin— An antibody in blood that combines\\nwith an antigen to form a solid that separates from\\nthe rest of the blood.\\nSpirometer— An instrument used to test a patient’s\\nlung capacity.\\n‘‘Wheal and flare’’ reaction—A rapid response to a\\nskin allergy test characterized by the development\\nof a red, itching spot in the area where the allergen\\nwas injected.\\nWheezing— A whistling or musical sound caused\\nby tightening of the air passages inside the patient’s\\nchest.\\n114 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 144, 'page_label': '145'}, page_content='Diagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of ABPA is based on a combination\\nof the patient’s history and the results of blood tests,\\nsputum tests, skin tests, and diagnostic imaging. The\\ndoctor will be concerned to distinguish between ABPA\\nand a worsening of the patient’sasthma,cystic fibrosis,o r\\nother lung disorders. There are seven major criteria for\\na diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis:\\n/C15a history of asthma.\\n/C15an accumulation of fluid in the lung that is visible on\\na chest x ray.\\n/C15bronchiectasis (abnormal stretching, enlarging, or\\ndestruction of the walls of the bronchial tubes).\\n/C15skin reaction toAspergillus antigen.\\n/C15eosinophilia in the patient’s blood and sputum.\\n/C15Aspergillus precipitins in the patient’s blood.\\nPrecipitins are antibodies that react with the antigen\\nto form a solid that separates from the rest of the\\nsolution in the test tube.\\n/C15a high level of IgE in the patient’s blood. IgE refers to\\na class of antibodies in blood plasma that activate\\nallergic reactions to foreign particles.\\nOther criteria that may be used to support the\\ndiagnosis include the presence ofAspergillus in sam-\\nples of the patient’s sputum, the coughing up of plugs\\nof brown mucus, or a late skin reaction to the\\nAspergillusantigen.\\nLaboratory tests\\nThe laboratory tests that are done to obtain this\\ninformation include a completeblood count(CBC), a\\nsputum culture, a blood serum test of IgE levels, and\\na skin test for theAspergillus antigen. In the skin test, a\\nsmall amount of antigen is injected into the upper\\nlayer of skin on the patient’s forearm about four\\ninches below the elbow. If the patient has a high\\nlevel of IgE antibodies in the tissue, he or she will\\ndevelop what is called a ‘‘wheal and flare’’ reaction\\nin about 15-20 minutes. A ‘‘wheal and flare’’ reaction\\nis characterized by the eruption of a reddened,itching\\nspot on the skin. Some patients with ABPA will\\ndevelop the so-called late reaction to the skin test, in\\nwhich a red, sore, swollen area develops about six to\\neight hours after the initial reaction.\\nDiagnostic imaging\\nChest x rays and CT scans are used to check for\\nthe presence of fluid accumulation in the lungs and\\nsigns of bronchiectasis.\\nTreatment\\nABPA is usually treated with prednisone\\n(Meticorten) or othercorticosteroids taken by mouth,\\nand withbronchodilators.\\nAntifungal drugs are not used to treat ABPA\\nbecause it is caused by an allergic reaction to\\nAspergillusrather than by direct infection of tissue.\\nFollow-up care\\nPatients with ABPA should be given periodic check-\\nupswith chestx rays and a spirometertest.Aspirometer is\\nan instrument that evaluates the patient’s lung capacity.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with ABPA respond well to corti-\\ncosteroid treatment. Others have a chronic course with\\ngradual improvement over time. The best indicator of\\na good prognosis is a long-term fall in the patient’s IgE\\nlevel. Patients with lung complications from ABPA\\nmay develop severe airway obstruction.\\nPrevention\\nABPA is difficult to prevent becauseAspergillus is\\na common fungus; it can be found in the saliva and\\nsputum of most healthy individuals. Patients with\\nABPA can protect themselves somewhat by avoiding\\nhaystacks, compost piles, bogs, marshes, and other\\nlocations with wet or rotting vegetation; by avoiding\\nconstruction sites or newly painted surfaces; and by\\nhaving their air conditioners cleaned regularly. Some\\npatients may be helped by air filtration systems for\\ntheir bedrooms or offices.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nStauffer, John L. ‘‘Lung.’’ InCurrent Medical Diagnosis and\\nTreatment, 1998, edited by Stephen McPhee, et al., 37th\\ned.

AP is also called Henoch-Schonlein\\npurpura, named after the two doctors who first\\ndescribed it.\\nDescription\\n‘‘Purpura’’ is a bleeding disorder that occurs when\\ncapillaries rupture, allowing small amounts of blood\\nto accumulate in the surrounding tissues. In AP, this\\noccurs because the capillaries are blocked by protein\\ncomplexes formed during an abnormal immune reac-\\ntion. The skin is the most obvious site of reaction, but\\nthe joints, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys are also\\noften affected.\\nAP affects approximately 35,000 people in the\\nUnited States each year. Most cases are children\\nbetween the ages of two and seven. Boys are affected\\nmore often than girls, and most cases occur from late\\nfall to winter.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAP is caused by a reaction involving antibodies,\\nspecial proteins of the immune system. Antibodies are\\ndesigned to bind with foreign proteins, called antigens.\\nIn some situations, antigen-antibody complexes can\\nbecome too large to remain suspended in the blood-\\nstream. When this occurs, they precipitate out and\\nbecome lodged in the capillaries. This can cause the\\ncapillary to burst, allowing a local hemorrhage.\\nThe source of the antigen causing AP is unknown.\\nAntigens may be introduced by bacterial or viral\\ninfection. More than 75% of patients report having had\\nan infection of the throat, upper respiratory tract, or\\ngastrointestinal system several weeks before the onset\\nof AP. Other complex molecules can act as antigens\\nas well, including drugs such asantibioticsor vaccines.\\nOtherwise harmless substances that stimulate an immune\\nreaction are known as allergens. Drug allergens that may\\ncause AP include penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin,\\nand quinine. Vaccines possibly linked to AP include\\nthose for typhoid, measles,cholera,a n dyellow fever.\\nSymptoms\\nThe onset of AP may be preceded by aheadache,\\nfever, and loss of appetite. Most patients first develop\\nan itchy skin rash. The rash is red, either flat or raised,\\nand may be small and freckle-like. The rash may also\\nbe larger, resembling a bruise.Rashes become purple\\nand then rust colored over the course of a day, and\\nfade after several weeks. Rashes are most common on\\nthe buttocks, abdomen, and lower extremities. Rashes\\nhigher on the body may also occur, especially in\\nyounger children.\\nJoint pain and swelling is common, especially\\nin the knees and ankles. Abdominal pain occurs in\\nalmost all patients, along with blood in the body\\nwaste (feces). About half of all patients show blood\\nin the urine, low urine volume, or other signs of kidney\\ninvolvement. Kidney failure may occur due to wide-\\nspread obstruction of the capillaries in the filtering\\nstructures called glomeruli. Kidney failure develops\\nin about 5% of all patients, and in 15% of those with\\nelevated blood or protein in the urine.\\nLess common symptoms include prolonged head-\\nache, fever, and pain and swelling of the scrotum.\\nInvolvement of other organ systems may lead to\\nheart attack (myocardial infarction), inflammation of\\nthe pancreas (pancreatitis), intestinal obstruction, or\\nbowel perforation.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of AP is based on the symptoms and\\ntheir development, a careful medical history, and\\nblood and urine tests. X rays or computed tomogra-\\nphy scans (CT) may be performed to assess complica-\\ntions in the bowel or other internal organs.\\nTreatment\\nMost cases of AP resolve completely without\\ntreatment. Nonetheless, a hospital stay is required\\nbecause of the possibility of serious complications.\\nNon-aspirin pain relievers may be given for joint\\npain.Corticosteroids (like prednisone) are sometimes\\nused, although not all specialists agree on their utility.\\nKidney involvement requires monitoring and correc-\\ntion of blood fluids and electrolytes.\\nPatients with severe kidney complications may\\nrequire a kidney biopsy so that tissue can be analyzed.\\nEven after all other symptoms subside, elevated levels\\nKEY TERMS\\nGlomeruli— Knots of capillaries in the kidneys\\nresponsible for filtering the blood (singular,\\nglomerulus).\\n116 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAllergic purpura'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 146, 'page_label': '147'}, page_content='of blood or protein in the urine may persist for months\\nand require regular monitoring.

It affects between 10-20% of all people in the\\nUnited States, and is responsible for 2.5% of all doctor\\nvisits.Antihistaminesand other drugs used to treat aller-\\ngic rhinitis make up a significant fraction of both\\nprescription and over-the-counter drug sales each year.\\nThere are two types of allergic rhinitis: seasonal\\nand perennial. Seasonal AR occurs in the spring, sum-\\nmer, and early fall, when airborne plant pollens are at\\ntheir highest levels. In fact, the term hayfever is really\\na misnomer, since allergy to grass pollen is only one\\ncause of symptoms for most people. Perennial AR\\noccurs all year and is usually caused by home or work-\\nplace airborne pollutants. A person can be affected\\nby one or both types. Symptoms of seasonal AR are\\nworst after being outdoors, while symptoms of peren-\\nnial AR are worst after spending time indoors.\\nBoth types ofallergies can develop at any age,\\nalthough onset in childhood through early adulthood\\nis most common. Although allergy to a particular\\nsubstance is not inherited, increased allergic sensitivity\\nmay ‘‘run in the family.’’ While allergies can improve\\non their own over time, they can also become worse\\nover time.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAllergic rhinitis is a type of immune reaction.\\nNormally, the immune system responds to foreign\\nThis illustration depicts excessive mucus production in the\\nnose after inhalation of airborne pollen.

This reaction between antibody\\nand antigen sets off a series of reactions designed to\\nprotect the body from infection. Sometimes, this same\\nseries of reactions is triggered by harmless, everyday\\nsubstances. This is the condition known as allergy,\\nand the offending substance is called an allergen.\\nLike all allergic reactions, AR involves a special\\nset of cells in the immune system known as mast cells.\\nMast cells, found in the lining of the nasal passages\\nand eyelids, display a special type of antibody, called\\nimmunoglobulin type E (IgE), on their surface. Inside,\\nmast cells store reactive chemicals in small packets,\\ncalled granules. When the antibodies encounter\\nallergens, they trigger release of the granules, which\\nspill out their chemicals onto neighboring cells, includ-\\ning blood vessels and nerve cells. One of these\\nchemicals, histamine, binds to the surfaces of these\\nother cells, through special proteins called histamine\\nreceptors. Interaction of histamine with receptors on\\nblood vessels causes neighboring cells to become\\nleaky, leading to the fluid collection, swelling, and\\nincreased redness characteristic of a runny nose and\\nred, irritated eyes. Histamine also stimulates pain\\nreceptors, causing the itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and\\nthroat common in allergic rhinitis.\\nThe number of possible airborne allergens is\\nenormous. Seasonal AR is most commonly caused\\nby grass and tree pollens, since their pollen is produced\\nin large amounts and is dispersed by the wind. Showy\\nflowers, like roses or lilacs, that attract insects produce\\na sticky pollen that is less likely to become airborne.\\nDifferent plants release their pollen at different times\\nof the year, so seasonal AR sufferers may be most\\naffected in spring, summer, or fall, depending on\\nwhich plants provoke a response. The amount of pollen\\nin the air is reflected in the pollen count, often broad-\\ncast on the daily news during allergy season. Pollen\\ncounts tend to be lower after a good rain that washes\\nthe pollen out of the air and higher on warm, dry,\\nwindy days.\\nVirtually any type of tree or grass may cause AR.\\nA few types of weeds that tend to cause the most\\ntrouble for people include the following:\\n/C15ragweed\\n/C15sagebrush\\n/C15lamb’s-quarters\\n/C15plantain\\n/C15pigweed\\n/C15dock/sorrel\\n/C15tumbleweed\\nPerennial AR is often triggered by house dust, a\\ncomplicated mixture of airborne particles, many of\\nwhich are potent allergens. House dust contains\\nsome or all of the following:\\n/C15house mite body parts. All houses contain large num-\\nbers of microscopic insects called house mites. These\\nharmless insects feed on fibers, fur, and skin shed by\\nthe house’s larger occupants. Their tiny body parts\\neasily become airborne.\\n/C15animal dander. Animals constantly shed fur, skin\\nflakes, and dried saliva. Carried in the air, or trans-\\nferred from pet to owner by direct contact, dander\\ncan cause allergy in many sensitive people.\\n/C15mold spores.

Inflammation causes itching,\\nsneezing, runny nose, redness, and tenderness. Sinus\\nswelling can constrict the eustachian tube that con-\\nnects the inner ear to the throat, causing a congested\\nfeeling and ‘‘ear popping.’’ The drip of mucus from the\\nsinuses down the back of the throat, combined with\\nincreased sensitivity, can also lead to throat irritation\\nand redness. AR usually also causes redness,itching,\\nand watery eyes. Fatigue and headache are also\\ncommon.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosing seasonal AR is usually easy and can\\noften be done without a medical specialist. When\\nsymptoms appear in spring or summer and disappear\\nwith the onset of cold weather, seasonal AR is almost\\ncertainly the culprit. Other causes of rhinitis, includ-\\ning infection, can usually be ruled out by aphysical\\nexamination and a nasal smear, in which a sample of\\nmucus is taken on a swab for examination.\\nAllergy tests, including skin testing and provo-\\ncation testing, can help identify the precise culprit,\\nbut may not be done unless a single source is\\nsuspected and subsequent avoidance is possible.\\nSkin testing involves placing a small amount of\\nliquid containing a specific allergen on the skin and\\nthen either poking, scratching, or injecting it into\\nthe skin surface to observe whether redness and\\nswellings occurs. Provocation testing involves chal-\\nlenging an individual with either a small amount of\\nan inhalable or ingestable allergen to see if a response\\nis elicited.\\nPerennial AR can also usually be diagnosed by\\ncareful questioning about the timing of exposure\\nand the onset of symptoms. Specific allergens can be\\nidentified through allergy skin testing.\\nTreatment\\nAvoidance of the allergens is the best treatment,\\nbut this is often not possible. When it is not possible to\\navoid one or more allergens, there are two major forms\\nof medical treatment, drugs and immunotherapy.\\nDrugs\\nANTIHISTAMINES. Antihistamines block the hista-\\nmine receptors on nasal tissue, decreasing the effect of\\nhistamine release by mast cells. They may be used after\\nsymptoms appear, though they may be even more\\neffective when used preventively, before symptoms\\nappear. A wide variety of antihistamines are available.\\nOlder antihistamines often produce drowsiness as\\na major side effect. Such antihistamines include the\\nfollowing:\\n/C15diphenhydramine (Benadryl and generics)\\n/C15chlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton and generics)\\n/C15brompheniramine (Dimetane and generics)\\n/C15clemastine (Tavist and generics).\\nNewer antihistamines that do not cause drowsi-\\nness are available by prescription and include the\\nfollowing:\\n/C15astemizole (Hismanal)\\n/C15fexofenadine (Allegra)\\n/C15cetirizine (Zyrtec)\\n/C15azelastin HCl (Astelin).\\nLoratidine (Claritin) was available only by pre-\\nscription but was released to over-the-counter status\\nby the FDA.\\nHismanal has the potential to cause serious heart\\narrhythmias when taken with the antibiotic erythro-\\nmycin, the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itracona-\\nzole, orthe antimalarialdrugquinine.Taking morethan\\nthe recommended dose of Hismanal can also cause\\narrhythimas. Seldane (terfenadine), the original non-\\ndrowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn from\\nthe market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because\\nof this potential and because of the availability of an\\nequally effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine.\\nLEUKOTRIENE RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS. Leuko-\\ntriene receptor antagonists (montelukast or Singulair\\nand zafirlukast or Accolate) are a newer class of drugs\\nused daily to help preventasthma. They’ve also become\\napproved in the United States to treat allergic rhinitis.\\nDECONGESTANTS. Decongestants constrict blood\\nvessels to counteract the effects of histamine.

Nasal sprays\\nare available that can be applied directly to the nasal\\nlining and oral systemic preparations are available.\\nDecongestants are stimulants and may cause increased\\nheart rate and blood pressure, headaches, isomnia,\\nagitation and difficulty emptying the bladder. Use of\\ntopical decongestants for longer than several days can\\ncause loss of effectiveness and rebound congestion, in\\nwhich nasal passages become more severely swollen\\nthan before treatment.\\nTOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. Topical corticoster-\\noids reduce mucous membrane inflammation and are\\navailable by prescription. Allergies tend to become\\nworse as the season progresses because the immune\\nsystem becomes sensitized to particular antigens and\\ncan produce a faster, stronger response. Topical\\ncorticosteroids are especially effective at reducing this\\nseasonal sensitization because they work more slowly\\nand last longer than most other medication types. As\\na result, they are best started before allergy season\\nbegins. Side effects are usually mild, but may include\\nheadaches, nosebleeds, and unpleasant taste sensations.\\nMAST CELL STABILIZERS. Cromolyn sodium pre-\\nvents the release of mast cell granules, thereby pre-\\nventing release of histamine and the other chemicals\\ncontained in them. It acts as a preventive treatment if it\\nis begun several weeks before the onset of the allergy\\nseason. It can be used for perennial AR as well.\\nImmunotherapy\\nImmunotherapy, also known as desensitization or\\nallergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types in the\\nbody,therebyreducingtheabilityofIgEtocauseallergic\\nreactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by allergy testing\\nto determine the precise allergens responsible. Injections\\ninvolve very small but gradually increasing amounts of\\nallergen, over several weeks or months, with periodic\\nboosters. Full benefits may take up to several years to\\nachieve and are not seen at all in about one in five\\npatients.

Odle\\nAllergies\\nDefinition\\nAllergies are abnormal reactions of the immune\\nsystem that occur in response to otherwise harmless\\nsubstances.\\nDescription\\nAllergies are among the most common of medical\\ndisorders. It is estimated that 60 million Americans, or\\nmore than one in every five people, suffer from some\\nform of allergy, with similar proportions throughout\\nmuch of the rest of the world. Allergy is the single\\nlargest reason for school absence and is a major source\\nof lost productivity in the workplace.\\nAn allergy is a type of immune reaction. Normally,\\nthe immune system responds to foreign microorgan-\\nisms or particles by producing specific proteins called\\nantibodies. These antibodies are capable of binding\\nto identifying molecules, or antigens, on the foreign\\nparticle. This reaction between antibody and antigen\\nsets off a series of chemical reactions designed to pro-\\ntect the body from infection. Sometimes, this same\\nseries of reactions is triggered by harmless, everyday\\nsubstances such as pollen, dust, and animal danders.\\nWhen this occurs, an allergy develops against the\\noffending substance (an allergen.)\\nMast cells, one of the major players in allergic\\nreactions, capture and display a particular type of\\nantibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE) that\\nbinds to allergens. Inside mast cells are small chemi-\\ncal-filled packets called granules. Granules contain a\\nvariety of potent chemicals, including histamine.\\nImmunologists separate allergic reactions into\\ntwo main types: immediate hypersensitivity reactions,\\nwhich are predominantly mast cell-mediated and\\noccur within minutes of contact with allergen; and\\ndelayed hypersensitivity reactions, mediated by\\nT cells (a type of white blood cells) and occurring\\nhours to days after exposure.\\nInhaled or ingested allergens usually cause\\nimmediate hypersensitivity reactions. Allergens bind\\nto IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cells, which\\nspill the contents of their granules out onto neighbor-\\ning cells, including blood vessels and nerve cells.\\nHistamine binds to the surfaces of these other cells\\nthrough special proteins called histamine receptors.\\nInteraction of histamine with receptors on blood ves-\\nsels causes increased leakiness, leading to the fluid\\ncollection, swelling and increased redness. Histamine\\nalso stimulatespain receptors, making tissue more\\nsensitive and irritable. Symptoms last from one to\\nseveral hours following contact.\\nIn the upper airways and eyes, immediate hyper-\\nsensitivity reactions cause the runny nose and itchy,\\nbloodshot eyes typical ofallergic rhinitis. In the gas-\\ntrointestinal tract, these reactions lead to swelling and\\nirritation of the intestinal lining, which causes the\\ncramping anddiarrhea typical of food allergy.\\nAllergens that enter the circulation may causehives,\\nangioedema, anaphylaxis,o ratopic dermatitis.\\nAllergens on the skin usually cause delayed hyper-\\nsensitivity reaction. Roving T cells contact the aller-\\ngen, setting in motion a more prolonged immune\\nresponse. This type of allergic response may develop\\nover several days following contact with the allergen,\\nand symptoms may persist for a week or more.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAllergens enter the body through four main\\nroutes: the airways, the skin, the gastrointestinal\\ntract, and the circulatory system.\\n/C15Airborne allergens cause the sneezing, runny nose,\\nand itchy, bloodshot eyes of hay fever (allergicrhini-\\ntis). Airborne allergens can also affect the lining of\\nthe lungs, causing asthma, or conjunctivitis (pink\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 121\\nAllergies'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 151, 'page_label': '152'}, page_content=\"Allergic rhinitis is commonly triggered by\\nexposure to household dust, animal fur,\\nor pollen.

Airborne\\nallergens from household pets are another common\\nsource of environmental exposure.\\n/C15Allergens in food can causeitching and swelling of\\nthe lips and throat, cramps, and diarrhea. When\\nabsorbed into the bloodstream, they may cause\\nhives (urticaria) or more severe reactions involving\\nrecurrent, non-inflammatory swelling of the skin,\\nmucous membranes, organs, and brain (angioe-\\ndema). Some food allergens may cause anaphylaxis,\\na potentially life-threatening condition marked by\\ntissue swelling, airway constriction, and drop in\\nblood pressure. Allergies to foods such as cow’s\\nmilk, eggs, nuts, fish, and legumes (peanuts and soy-\\nbeans) are common. Allergies to fruits and vegeta-\\nbles may also occur.\\n/C15In contact with the skin, allergens can cause redden-\\ning, itching, and blistering, called contactdermatitis.\\nSkin reactions can also occur from allergens intro-\\nduced through the airways or gastrointestinal tract.\\nThis type of reaction is known as atopic dermatitis.\\nDermatitis may arise from an allergic response (such\\nas from poison ivy), or exposure to an irritant caus-\\ning nonimmune damage to skin cells (such as soap,\\ncold, and chemical agents).\\n/C15Injection of allergens, from insectbites and stingsor\\ndrug administration, can introduce allergens directly\\ninto the circulation, where they may cause system-\\nwide responses (including anaphylaxis), as well as\\nthe local ones of swelling and irritation at the injec-\\ntion site.\\nPeople with allergies are not equally sensitive to\\nall allergens.

One source of this\\ngenetic predisposition is in the ability to produce higher\\nlevels of IgE in response to allergens. Those who produce\\nmore IgE will develop a stronger allergic sensitivity.\\nCOMMON ALLERGENS. The most common air-\\nborne allergens are the following:\\n/C15plant pollens\\n/C15animal fur and dander\\n/C15body parts from house mites (microscopic creatures\\nfound in all houses)\\n/C15house dust\\n/C15mold spores\\n/C15cigarette smoke\\n/C15solvents\\n/C15cleaners\\nCommon food allergens include the following:\\nThe following types of drugs commonly cause\\nallergic reactions:\\n/C15penicillin or otherantibiotics\\n/C15flu vaccines\\n/C15tetanus toxoid vaccine\\n/C15gamma globulin\\nCommon causes ofcontact dermatitisinclude the\\nfollowing:\\n/C15poison ivy, oak, and sumac\\n/C15nickel or nickel alloys\\n/C15latex\\nInsects and other arthropods whose bites or stings\\ntypically cause allergy include the following:\\n/C15bees, wasps, and hornets\\n/C15mosquitoes\\n/C15fleas\\n/C15scabies\\nSymptoms depend on the specific type of allergic\\nreaction. Allergic rhinitis is characterized by an itchy,\\nrunny nose, often with a scratchy or irritated throat\\ndue to post-nasal drip. Inflammation of the thin mem-\\nbrane covering the eye (allergicconjunctivitis) causes\\nredness, irritation, and increased tearing in the eyes.\\nAsthma causeswheezing, coughing, and shortness of\\nbreath. Symptoms of food allergies depend on the\\ntissues most sensitive to the allergen and whether the\\nallergen was spread systemically by the circulatory\\nsystem. Gastrointestinal symptoms may include swel-\\nling andtingling in the lips, tongue, palate or throat;\\nnausea; cramping; diarrhea; and gas. Contact derma-\\ntitis is marked by reddened, itchy, weepy skin blisters,\\nand an eczema that is slow to heal. It sometimes has a\\ncharacteritic man-made pattern, such as a glove\\nallergy with clear demarkation on the hands, wrist,\\nand arms where the gloves are worn, or on the earlobes\\nby wearing earrings.\\nWhole body or systemic reactions may occur from\\nany type of allergen, but are more common following\\ningestion or injection of an allergen. Skin reactions\\ninclude the raised, reddened, and itchy patches called\\nhives that characteristically blanch with pressure and\\nresolve within twenty-four hours. A deeper and more\\nextensive skin reaction, involving more extensive fluid\\ncollection and pain, is called angioedema. This usually\\noccurs on the extremities, fingers, toes, and parts of the\\nhead, neck, and face. Anaphylaxis is marked by airway\\nconstriction, blood pressure drop, widespread tissue\\nswelling, heart rhythm abnormalities, and in some\\ncases, loss of consciousness. Other syptoms may\\ninclude,dizziness, weakness, seizures, coughing, flush-\\ning, or cramping. The symptoms may begin within five\\nminutes after exposure to the allergen up to one hour\\nor more later. Mast cells in the tissues and basophils in\\nthe blood release mediators that give rise to the clinical\\nsymptoms of this IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reac-\\ntion. Commonly, this is associated with allergies to\\nmedications, foods, and insect venoms. In some indivi-\\nduals, anaphylaxis can occur withexercise,p l a s m a\\nexchange, hemodialysis, reaction to insulin, contrast\\nmedia used in certain types of medical tests, and rarely\\nduring the administration of local anesthetics.\\nDiagnosis\\nAllergies can often be diagnosed by a careful med-\\nical history, matching the onset of symptoms to the\\nexposure to possible allergens. Allergy is suspected if\\nthe symptoms presented are characteristic of an aller-\\ngic reaction and this occurs repeatedly upon exposure\\nto the suspected allergen.Allergy testscan be used to\\nidentify potential allergens, but these must be sup-\\nported by eveidence of allergic responses in the\\npatient’s clinical history.\\nSkin tests\\nSkin tests are performed by administering a tiny\\ndose of the suspected allergen by pricking, scratching,\\n124 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAllergies'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 154, 'page_label': '155'}, page_content='puncturing or injecting the skin. The allergen is\\napplied to the skin as an auqeous extract, usually on\\nthe back, forearms, or top of the thighs. Once in the\\nskin, the allergen may produce a classic immune wheal\\nand flare response (a skin lesion with a raised, white,\\ncompressible area surrounded by a red flare). The tests\\nusually begin with prick tests or patch tests that expose\\nthe skin to small amounts of allergen to observe the\\nresponse. A positive reaction will occur on the skin\\neven if the allergen is at levels normally encountered in\\nfood or in the airways. Reactions are usually evaluated\\napproximately fifteen minutes after exposure.\\nIntradermal skin tests involved injection of the aller-\\ngen into the dermis of the skin. These tests are more\\nsensitive and are used for allergies associated with risk\\nofdeath, such as allergies to antibiotics.\\nAllergen-Specific IgE Measurement\\nTests that measure allergen-specific IgE antibo-\\ndies generally follow a basic method. The allergen is\\nbound to a solid support, either in the form of a\\ncellulose sponge, microtiter plate, or paper disk. The\\npatient’s serum is prepared from a blood sample and is\\nincubated with the solid phase. If allergen specific IgE\\nantibodies are present, they will bind to the solid phase\\nand be retained there when the rest of the serum is\\nwashed away. Next, an labeled antibody against the\\nIgE is added and will bind to any IgE on the solid\\nphase. The excess is washed away and the levels of IgE\\nare determined. The commonly used RAST test (radio\\nallergo sorbent test) employed radio-labeled Anti-IgE\\nantibodies. Updated methods now incorporate the use\\nof enyzme-labeled antibodies in ELISA assays\\n(enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays).\\nTotal Serum IgE\\nThe total level of IgE in the serum is commonly\\nmeasured with a two-site immunometric assay. Some\\nresearch indicates that there is a higher level of total\\nserum IgE in allergic as compared to non-allergic\\npeople. However, this may not always be the case as\\nthere is considerable overlap between the two groups.\\nThis test is useful for the diagnosis of allergic fungal\\nsinusitis and bronchopulmonaryaspergillosis. Other\\nconditions that are not allergic in nature may give\\nrise to higher IgE levels such assmoking, AIDS, infec-\\ntion with parasites, and IgE myeloma.\\nProvocation tests\\nThese tests involve the administration of allergen to\\nelicit an immune response. Provocation tests, most com-\\nmonly done with airborne allergens, present the allergen\\ndirectly through the routenormally involved. Delayed\\nallergic contact dermatitis diagnosis involves similar\\nmethods by application of a skin patch with allergen\\nto induce an allergic skin reaction. Food allergen provo-\\ncation tests require abstinence from the suspect allergen\\nf o rt w ow e e k so rm o r e ,f o l l o w e db yi n g e s t i o no fa\\nmeasured amount of the test substance administered as\\nan opaque capsule along with a placebo control.\\nProvocation tests are not used if anaphylaxis is is a\\nconcern due to the patient’s medical history.\\nFuture diagnostic methods\\nAttempts have been made for direct measurement\\nof immune mediators such as histamine, eosinophil\\ncationic protein (ECP), and mast cell tryptase.\\nAnother, somewhat controversial,test is electrodermal\\ntesting or electro-acupuncture allergy testing. This test\\nhas been used in Europe and is under investigation in\\nthe United States, though not approved by the Food\\nand Drug Administration. An electric potential is\\napplied to the skin, the allergen presented, and the\\nelectrical resistance observed for changes. This\\nmethod has not been verified.\\nTreatment\\nAvoiding allergens is the first line of defense to\\nreduce the possibility of an allergic attack. It is helpful\\nto avoid environmental irritants such as tobacco\\nsmoke, perfumes, household cleaning agents, paints,\\nglues, air fresheners, and potpourri. Nitrogen dioxide\\nfrom poorly vented gas stoves, woodburning stoves,\\nand artificial fireplaces has also been linked to poor\\nasthma control. Dust mite control is particularly\\nimportant in the bedroom areas by use of allergen-\\nimpermeable covers on mattress and pillows, frequent\\nwashing of bedding in hot water, and removal of items\\nthat collect dust such as stuffed toys. Mold growth may\\nbe reduced by lowering indoor humidity, repair of\\nhouse foundations to reduce indoor leaks and seepage,\\nand installing exhaust systems to ventilate areas where\\nsteam is generated such as the bathroom or kitchen.\\nAllergic individuals should avoid pet allergens such as\\nsaliva, body excretions, pelts, urine, or feces. For those\\nwho insist on keeping a pet, restriction of the animal’s\\nactivity to certain areas of the home may be beneficial.\\nComplete environmental control is often difficult\\nto accomplish, hence therapuetic interventions may\\nbecome necessary.

They may be used after symptoms appear,\\nthough they may be even more effective when used\\npreventively, before symptoms appear. Antihistamines\\nhelp reduce sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea.

It is the only nonsedating\\nantihistamine approved as of 2004 for children as\\nyoung as six months.\\nHismanal has the potential to cause serious heart\\narrhythmiaswhen taken with the antibiotic erythromy-\\ncin, the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itraconazole,\\nor the antimalarial drug quinine. Taking more than the\\nrecommended dose of Hismanal can also cause\\narrhythimas. Seldane (terfenadine), the original non-\\ndrowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn from\\nthe market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because of\\nthis potential and because of the availability of an\\nequally effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine.\\nDecongestants\\nDecongestants constrict blood vessels to the\\nmucosa to counteract the effects of histamine. This\\ndecreases the amount of blood in the nasopahryngeal\\nand sinus mucosa and reduces swelling. Nasal sprays\\nare available that can be applied directly to the nasal\\nlining and oral systematic preparations are available.\\nDecongestants are stimulants and may cause increased\\nheart rate and blood pressure, headaches,insomnia,\\nagitation, and difficulty emptying the bladder. Use of\\ntopical decongestants for longer than several days can\\ncause loss of effectiveness and rebound congestion,\\nin which nasal passages become more severely swollen\\nthan before treatment.\\nTopical corticosteroids\\nTopical corticosteroids reduce mucous membrane\\ninflammation by decreasing the amount of fluid moved\\nfrom the vascular spaces into the tissues. These medica-\\ntions reduce the recruitment of inflammatory cells as\\nwell as the synthesis of cytokines. They are available by\\nprescription. Allergies tend to become worse as the\\nseason progresses because the immune system becomes\\nsensitized to particular antigens and can produce a\\nfaster, stronger response. Topical corticosteroids are\\nespecially effective at reducing this seasonal sensitiza-\\ntion because they work more slowly and last longer\\nthan most other medication types. As a result, they\\nare best started before allergy season begins. Side\\neffects are usually mild, but may include headaches,\\nnosebleeds, and unpleasant taste sensations.\\nBronchodilators or metered-dose inhalers (MDI)\\nBecause allergic reactions involving the lungs\\ncause the airways or bronchial tubes to narrow, as in\\nasthma,bronchodilators, which cause the smooth mus-\\ncle lining the airways to open or dilate, can be very\\neffective. When inhalers are used, it is important that\\nthe patient be educated in the proper use of these\\nmedications. The inhaler should be shaken, and the\\npatient should breathe out to expel air from the lungs.\\nThe inhaler should be placed at least two finger-\\nbreadths in front of the mouth. The medication should\\nbe aimed at the back of the throat, and the inhaler\\nactivated while breathing in quite slowly 3-4 seconds.\\nThe breath should be held for at least ten seconds, and\\nthen expelled. At least thirty to sixty seconds should\\npass before the inhaler is used again. Care should be\\ntaken to properly wash out the mouth and brush the\\nteeth following use, as residual medication remains in\\nthis area with only a small amount actually reaching\\nthe lungs. Some bronchodilators used to treat acute\\nasthma attacks include adrenaline, albuterol, Maxair,\\nProventil, or other ‘‘adrenoceptor stimulants,’’ most\\noften administered as aerosols.

Other\\nmedications may be given to aid the action of the epi-\\npen. Prompt injection can prevent a more serious\\nreaction from developing. Particular care should be\\ntaken to assess the affected individual’s airway status,\\nand he or she should be placed in a recumbent pose\\nand vital signs determined. If a reaction resulted from\\ninsect sting or an injection, a tourniquet may need\\nto be placed proximal to the area where the agent\\npenetrated the skin. This should then be released at\\nintervals of ten minutes at a time, for one to two\\nminutes duration. If the individual does not respond\\nto such interventions, then emergency treatment is\\nappropriate.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAny alternative treatment for allergies begins with\\nfinding the cause and then helping the patient to avoid\\nor eliminate the allergen, although this is not always\\npossible.

This is\\nthe condition known as allergy, and the offending\\nsubstance is called an allergen. Common inhaled\\nallergens include pollen,dust, and insect parts from\\ntiny house mites. Common food allergens include\\nnuts, fish, and milk.\\nAllergic reactions involve a special set of cells\\nin the immune system known as mast cells. Mast\\ncells serve as guards in the tissues where the body\\nmeets the outside world: the skin, the mucous\\nmembranes of the eyes and other areas, and the lin-\\nings of the respiratory and digestive systems. Mast\\ncells display a special typeof antibody, called immu-\\nnoglobulin type E (IgE), on their surface. Inside,\\nmast cells store reactive chemicals in small packets,\\ncalled granules. When the antibodies encounter aller-\\ngens, they trigger the release of granules, which spill\\nout their chemicals onto neighboring cells, including\\nblood vessels and nerve cells. One of these chemicals,\\nhistamine, binds to the surfaces of these other cells,\\nthrough special proteins called histamine receptors.\\nInteraction of histamine with receptors on blood\\nvessels causes neighboring cells to become leaky,\\nleading to the fluid collection, swelling, and increased\\nredness characteristic of a runny nose and red, irri-\\ntated eyes. Histamine also stimulatespain receptors,\\ncausing the itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat\\ncommon inallergic rhinitis.\\nThe particular allergens to which a person is sen-\\nsitive can be determined through allergy testing.\\nAllergy tests may be performed on the skin or using\\nblood serum in a test tube. During skin tests, potential\\nallergens are placed on the skin and the reaction\\nis observed. In radio-allergosorbent allergy testing\\n(RAST), a patient’s blood serum is combined\\nwith allergen in a test tube to determine if serum anti-\\nbodies react with the allergen. Provocation testing\\ninvolves direct exposure to a likely allergen, either\\nthrough inhalation or ingestion. Positive reactions\\nfrom any of these tests may be used to narrow the\\ncandidates for the actual allergen causing the allergy.\\nIdentification of the allergenic substance may\\nallow the patient to avoid the substance and reduce\\nallergic reactions. In addition, allergy testing may\\nbe done in those withasthma that is difficult to\\nmanage, eczema, or skin rashes to determine if an\\nallergy is causing the condition or making it worse.\\nAllergy tests may also be done before allergen desensi-\\ntization to ensure the safety of more extensive exposure.\\nSkin testing is the most common type of allergy test.\\nThere are two forms: percutaneous and intradermal. In\\npercutaneous or prick testing, allergen solutions are\\nplaced on the skin, and the skin is then pricked with a\\nneedle, allowing the allergen to enter the skin and\\nbecome exposed to mast cells. Scratch testing, in which\\nthe skin is scratched instead of punctured, is used less\\noften. Intradermal testing involves directly injecting\\nallergen solutions into the skin.

Odle\\nAlpha-fetoprotein test\\nDefinition\\nThe alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test is a blood test\\nthat is performed duringpregnancy. This screening\\ntest measures the level of AFP in the mother’s blood\\nand indicates the probability that the fetus has one\\nof several serious birth defects. The level of AFP can\\nalso be determined by analyzing a sample of amniotic\\nfluid. This screening test cannot diagnose a specific\\ncondition; it only indicates increased risk for several\\nbirth defects. Outside pregnancy, the AFP test is used\\nto detectliver disease, certain cancerous tumors, and\\nto monitor the progress of cancer treatment.\\nPurpose\\nAlpha-fetoprotein is a substance produced by the\\nliver of a fetus. The exact function of this protein is\\nunknown. After birth, the infant’s liver stops producing\\nAFP, and an adult liver contains only trace amounts.\\nDuring pregnancy, the fetus excretes AFP in urine and\\nsome of the protein crosses the fetal membranes to\\nenter the mother’s blood. The level of AFP can then\\nbe determined by analyzing a sample of the mother’s\\nblood. By analyzing the amount of AFP found in a\\nblood or amniotic fluid sample, doctors can determine\\nthe probability that the fetus is at risk for certain birth\\ndefects. It is very important that the doctor know\\nprecisely how old the fetus is when the test is performed\\nsince the AFP level changes over the length of the\\npregnancy. Alone, AFP screening cannot diagnose a\\nbirth defect. The test is used as an indicator of risk and\\nthen an appropriate line of testing (such asamniocent-\\nesis or ultrasound) follows, based on the results.\\nAbnormally high AFP may indicate that the\\nfetus has an increased risk of a neural tube defect,\\nthe most common and severe type of disorder\\nassociated with increased AFP.

This leakage\\ncreates abnormally high levels of AFP in amniotic\\nfluid and in maternal blood. If the screening test\\nindicates abnormally high AFP, ultrasound is used\\nto diagnose the problem.\\nOther fetal conditions that can raise AFP levels\\nabove normal include:\\n/C15cysts at the end of the spine\\n/C15blockage in the esophagus or intestines\\n/C15liver disease causing liver cells to die\\n/C15defects in the abdominal wall\\n/C15kidney or urinary tract defects or disease\\n/C15brittle bone disease\\nLevels may also be high if there is too little fluid in\\nthe amniotic sac around the fetus, more than one\\ndeveloping fetus, or a pregnancy that is farther along\\nthan estimated.\\nFor unknown reasons, abnormally low AFP may\\nindicate that the fetus has an increased risk ofDown\\nsyndrome. Down syndrome is a condition that includes\\nmental retardation and a distinctive physical appearance\\nlinked to an abnormality ofchromosome 21 (called\\ntrisomy 21). If the screening test indicates an abnormally\\nlow AFP, amniocentesis is used to diagnose the problem.\\nAbnormally low levels of AFP can also occur when\\nthe fetus has died or when the mother is overweight.\\nAFP is often part of a ‘‘triple check’’ blood test\\nthat analyzes three substances as risk indicators of\\npossible birth defects: AFP, estriol, and human chor-\\nionic gonadotropin (HCG). When all three substances\\nare measured in the mother’s blood, the accuracy of\\nthe test results increases.\\nIn 2004, a new study showed that the risk of an\\ninfant’s death from sudden infant death syndrome\\n(SIDS) increased if levels of AFP were higher during\\nthe second trimester of the mother’s pregnancy.\\nAlthough AFP in human blood gradually disap-\\npears after birth, it never disappears entirely. It may\\nreappear in liver disease, or tumors of the liver, ovar-\\nies, or testicles. The AFP test is used to screen people\\nat high risk for these conditions. After a cancerous\\ntumor is removed, an AFP test can monitor the\\nprogress of treatment. Continued high AFP levels\\nsuggest thecancer is growing.\\nPrecautions\\nIt is very important that the doctor know precisely\\nhow old the fetus is when the test is performed since\\nthe AFP level considered normal changes over the\\nlength of the pregnancy. Errors in determining the\\nage of the fetus lead to errors when interpreting\\nthe test results. Since an AFP test is only a screening\\ntool, more specific tests must follow to make an accu-\\nrate diagnosis. An abnormal test result does not neces-\\nsarily mean that the fetus has a birth defect.

Odle\\nAlpha-thalassemia see Thalassemia\\nAlpha1-adrenergic blockers\\nDefinition\\nAlpha1-adrenergic blockers are drugs that work\\nby blocking the alpha1-receptors of vascular smooth\\nmuscle, thus preventing the uptake of catecholamines\\nby the smooth muscle cells. This causes vasodilation\\nand allows blood to flow more easily.\\nPurpose\\nThese drugs, called alpha blockers for short, are\\nused for two main purposes: to treat high blood pres-\\nsure (hypertension) and to treat benign prostatic\\nhyperplasia (BPH), a condition that affects men and\\nis characterized by anenlarged prostategland.\\nHigh blood pressure\\nHigh blood pressure puts a strain on the heart and\\nthe arteries. Over time, hypertension can damage the\\nblood vessels to the point of causingstroke, heart fail-\\nure or kidney failure. People with high blood pressure\\nmay also be at higher risk for heart attacks.\\nControlling high blood pressure makes these problems\\nless likely. Alpha blockers help lower blood pressure\\nby causing vasodilation, meaning an increase in the\\ndiameter of the blood vessels, which allows blood to\\nflow more easily.\\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)\\nThis condition particularly affects older men.\\nOver time, the prostate, a donut-shaped gland\\nbelow the bladder, enlarges. When this happens, it\\nmay interfere with the passage of urine from the\\nbladder out of the body. Men who are diagnosed\\nwith BPH may have to urinate more often. Or they\\nmay feel that they can not completely empty their\\nbladders. Alpha blockers inhibit the contraction of\\nprostatic smooth muscle and thus relax muscles in\\nthe prostate and the bladder, allowing urine to flow\\nmore freely.\\nDescription\\nCommonly prescribed alpha blockers for hyper-\\ntension and BPH include doxazosin (Cardura, prazo-\\nsin (Minipress) and terazosin (Hytrin). Prazosin is also\\nused in the treatment of heart failure. All are available\\nonly with a physician’s prescription and are sold in\\ntablet form.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dose depends on the patient\\nand the type of alpha blocker and may change over\\nthe course of treatment. The prescribing physician will\\ngradually increase the dosage, if necessary. Some\\npatients may need as much as 15-20 mg per day of\\nterazosin, 16 mg per day of doxazosin, or as much as\\n40 mg per day of prazosin, but most people benefit\\nfrom lower doses. As the dosage increases, so does the\\npossibility of unwanted side effects.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 135\\nAlpha1-adrenergic blockers'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 165, 'page_label': '166'}, page_content='Alpha blockers should be taken exactly as direc-\\nted, even if the medication does not seem to be work-\\ning at first.

Eventually,kidney dialysisor trans-\\nplant may be necessary.\\nDescription\\nAlport syndrome affects about one in 5,000\\nAmericans, striking men more often and severely\\nthan women. There are several varieties of the syn-\\ndrome, some occurring in childhood and others not\\ncausing symptoms until men reach their 20s or 30s. All\\nvarieties of the syndrome are characterized bykidney\\ndisease that usually progresses to chronic kidney fail-\\nure and by uremia (the presence of excessive amounts\\nof urea and other waste products in the blood).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAlport syndrome in most cases is caused by a\\ndefect in one or more genes located on the X chromo-\\nsome. It is usually inherited from the mother, who is a\\nnormal carrier. However, in up to 20% of cases there is\\nno family history of the disorder. In these cases, there\\nappears to be a spontaneous genetic mutation causing\\nAlport syndrome.\\nBlood in the urine (hematuria) is a hallmark of\\nAlport syndrome.

High altitude is defined\\nas height greater than 8,000 feet (2,438m); medium\\naltitude is defined as height between 5,000 and 8,000\\nfeet (1,524-2,438m); and extreme altitude is defined as\\nheight greater than 19,000 feet (5,791 m). The majority\\nof healthy individuals suffer from altitude sickness when\\nthey reach very high altitudes. In addition, about 20%\\nof people ascending above 9,000 feet (2,743m) in one\\nday will develop altitude sickness. Children under six\\nyears and women in the premenstrual part of their cycles\\nmay be more vulnerable. Individuals with preexisting\\nmedical conditions–even a minor respiratory infection–\\nmay become sick at more moderate altitudes.\\nDescription\\nThere are three major clinical syndromes that fall\\nunder the heading of altitude sickness: acute mountain\\nsickness (AMS), high-altitude pulmonary edema\\n(HAPE), and high-altitude cerebraledema (HACE).\\nThese syndromes are not separate, individual syn-\\ndromes as much as they are a continuum of severity,\\nall resulting from a decrease in oxygen in the air. AMS\\nis the mildest, and the other two represent severe, life-\\nthreatening forms of altitude sickness.\\nAltitude sickness occurs because the partial pres-\\nsure of oxygen decreases with altitude. (Partial pres-\\nsure is a term applied to gases that is similar to the way\\nthe term concentration is applied to liquid solutions.)\\nFor instance, at 18,000 feet (5,486 m) the partial pres-\\nsure of oxygen drops to one-half its value at sea level\\nand, therefore, there is a substantially lower amount of\\noxygen available for the individual to inhale. This is\\nknown as hypoxia. Furthermore, since there is less\\noxygen to inhale, less oxygen reaches the blood. This\\nis known as hypoxemia. These two conditions are the\\nmajor factors that form the basis for all the medical\\nproblems associated with altitude sickness.\\nAs a person becomes hypoxemic, his natural\\nresponse is to breathe more rapidly (hyperventilate).\\nThis is the body’s attempt to bring in more oxygen at\\na rapid rate. This attempt at alleviating the effects of the\\nhypoxia at higher altitudes is known as acclimatization,\\nand it occurs during the first few days. Acclimatization\\nis a response that occurs in individuals who travel from\\nlower to higher altitudes. There are groups of people\\nwho have lived at high altitudes (for example, in the\\nHimalayan and Andes mountains) for generations, and\\nthey are simply accustomed to living at such altitudes,\\nperhaps through a genetic ability.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute mountain sickness (AMS) is a mild form of\\naltitude sickness that results from ascent to altitudes\\nhigher greater than 8,000 feet (2,438m)–even 6,500 feet\\n(1,981 m) in some susceptible individuals. Although\\nhypoxia is associated with the development of AMS,\\nthe exact mechanism by which this condition develops\\nhas yet to be confirmed. It is important to realize that\\nsome individuals acclimatize to higher altitudes more\\nefficiently than others. As a result, under similar condi-\\ntions some will suffer from AMS while others will not.\\nAt present, the susceptibility of otherwise healthy indi-\\nviduals to contracting AMS cannot be accurately pre-\\ndicted. Of those who do suffer from AMS, the condition\\ntends to be most severe on the second or third day after\\nreaching the high altitude, and it usually abates after\\nthree to five days if they remain at the same\\naltitude. However, it can recur if the individuals travel\\nto an even higher altitude. Symptoms usually appear a\\nfew hours to a few days following ascent, and they\\ninclude dizziness, headache, shortness of breath, nausea,\\nvomiting,l o s so fa p p e t i t e ,a n dinsomnia.\\nHigh-altitude pulmonary edema(HAPE) is a life-\\nthreatening condition that afflicts a small percentage\\nof those who suffer from AMS. In this condition, fluid\\nleaks from within the pulmonary blood vessels into the\\nlung tissue. As this fluid begins to accumulate within\\nKEY TERMS\\nCerebral— Pertaining to the brain.\\nEdema— Accumulation of excess fluid in the tissues\\nof the body.\\nHypoxemia— Insufficient oxygenation of the blood.\\nHypoxia— A deficiency in the amount of oxygen\\nrequired for effective ventilation.\\nPulmonary— Pertaining to the lungs.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 139\\nAltitude sickness'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 169, 'page_label': '170'}, page_content='the lung tissue (pulmonary edema), the individual\\nbegins to become more and more short of breath.\\nHAPE is known to afflict all types of individuals,\\nregardless of their level of physical fitness.\\nTypically, the individual who suffers from HAPE\\nascends quickly to a high altitude and almost imme-\\ndiately develops shortness of breath, a rapid heart\\nrate, acough productive of a large amount of some-\\ntimes bloody sputum, and a rapid rate of breathing.\\nIf no medical assistance is provided by this point,\\nthe patient goes into a coma and dies within a few\\nhours.\\nHigh-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), the rarest\\nand most severe form of altitude sickness, involves\\ncerebral edema, and its mechanism of development is\\nalso poorly understood. The symptoms often begin\\nwith those of AMS, but neurologic symptoms such\\nas an altered level of consciousness, speech abnormal-\\nities, severe headache, loss of coordination,hallucina-\\ntions, and even seizures. If no intervention is\\nimplemented, death is the result.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis for altitude sickness may be made\\nfrom the observation of the individual’s symptoms\\nduring travel to higher altitudes.\\nTreatment\\nMild AMS requires no treatment other than an\\naspirin or ibuprofen for headache, and avoidance of\\nfurther ascent. Narcotics should be avoided because\\nthey may blunt the respiratory response, making\\nit even more difficult for the person to breathe deeply\\nand rapidly enough to compensate for the lower levels\\nof oxygen in the environment. Oxygen may also be\\nused to alleviate symptoms of mild AMS.\\nAs for HAPE and HACE, the most important\\ncourse of action is descent to a lower altitude as soon\\nas possible. Even a 1,000-2,000-foot (305-610 m) des-\\ncent can dramatically improve one’s symptoms. If\\ndescent is not possible,oxygen therapy should be\\nstarted. In addition, dexamethasone (a steroid) has\\nbeen suggested in order to reduce cerebral edema.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for mild AMS is good, if appro-\\npriate measures are taken. As for HAPE and HACE,\\nthe prognosis depends upon the rapidity and distance\\nof descent and the availability of medical intervention.\\nDescent often leads to improvement of symptoms,\\nhowever, recovery times vary among individuals.\\nPrevention\\nWhen individuals ascend from sea level, it is recom-\\nmended that they spend at least one night at\\nan intermediate altitude prior to ascending to higher\\nelevations. In general, climbers should take at least two\\ndays to go from sea level to 8,000 feet (2,438m). After\\nreaching that point, healthy climbers should generally\\nallow one day for each additional 2,000 feet (610m), and\\none day of rest should be taken every two or three days.\\nShould mild symptoms begin to surface, further ascent\\nshould be avoided. If the symptoms are severe, the indi-\\nvidual should return to a lower altitude. Some reports\\nindicate that acetazolamide (a diuretic) may be taken\\nbefore ascent as a preventative measure for AMS.\\nPaying attention to diet can also help prevent alti-\\ntude sickness. Water loss is a problem at higher alti-\\ntudes, so climbers should drink ample water (enough to\\nproduce copious amounts of relatively light-colored or\\nclear urine). Alcohol and large amounts of salt should\\nbe avoided. Eating frequent small, high-carbohydrate\\nsnacks (for example, fruits, jams and starchy foods)\\ncan help, especially in the first few days of climbing.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCrystal, R.

Most\\npeople who have AD die within eight years of their\\ndiagnosis, although the interval may be as short as one\\nyear or as long as 20 years. AD is the fourth leading\\ncause ofdeath in adults after heart disease,cancer,a n d\\nstroke.\\nBetween two and four million Americans have\\nAD; that number is expected to grow to as many as\\n14 million by the middle of the 21st century as the\\npopulation ages. While a small number of people in\\ntheir 40s and 50s develop the disease (called early-\\nonset AD), AD predominantly affects the elderly.\\nAD affects about 3% of all people between ages 65\\nand 74, about 19% of those between 75 and 84, and\\nabout 47% of those over 85. Slightly more women\\nthan men are affected with AD, but this may be\\nbecause women tend to live longer, leaving a higher\\nproportion of women in the most affected age groups.\\nThe cost of caring for a person with AD is con-\\nsiderable. The annual cost of caring for one AD\\npatient in 1998 was estimated as about $18,400 for a\\npatient with mild AD, $30,100 for a patient with mod-\\nerate AD, and $36,100 for a patient with severe AD.\\nThe annual direct and indirect costs of caring for AD\\npatients in the United States was estimated to be as\\nmuch as $100 billion. Slightly more than half of people\\nwith AD are cared for at home, while the remainder\\nare cared for in a variety of health care institutions.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe cause or causes of Alzheimer’s disease are lar-\\ngely unknown, though some forms have genetic links.\\nSome strong leads have been found through recent\\nresearch, however, and these have given some theoreti-\\ncal support to several new experimental treatments.\\nAt first AD destroys neurons (nerve cells) in parts\\nof the brain that control memory, including the\\nhippocampus, which is a structure deep in the deep\\nthat controls short-term memory. As these neurons\\nin the hippocampus stop functioning, the person’s\\nshort-term memory fails, and the ability to perform\\nfamiliar tasks decreases. Later AD affects the cerebral\\ncortex, particularly the areas responsible for language\\nand reasoning. Many language skills are lost and the\\nability to make judgments is affected. Personality\\nchanges occur, which may include emotional out-\\nbursts, wandering, and agitation. The severity of\\nthese changes increases with disease progression.\\nEventually many other areas of the brain become\\ninvolved, the brain regions affected atrophy (shrink\\nand lose function), and the person with AD becomes\\nbedridden, incontinent, helpless, and non-responsive.\\nAutopsy of a person with AD shows that the\\nregions of the brain affected by the disease become\\nclogged with two abnormal structures, called neuro-\\nfibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. Neurofibrillary\\ntangles are twisted masses of protein fibers inside nerve\\ncells, or neurons. In AD, tau proteins, which normally\\nhelp bind and stabilize parts of neurons, are changed\\nchemically, become twisted and tangled, and no longer\\ncan stabilize the neurons. Amyloid plaques consist of\\ninsoluble deposits of beta-amyloid, (a protein fragment\\nfrom a larger protein called amyloid precursor protein\\n(APP), mixed with parts of neurons and non-nerve\\ncells. Plaques are found in the spaces between the\\nnerve cells of the brain.

Two types of AD exist: familial AD (FAD),\\nwhich is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disease,\\nand sporadic AD, with no obvious inheritance pat-\\ntern. AD also is described in terms of age at onset, with\\nearly onset AD occurring in people younger than 65,\\nand late-onset occurring in those 65 and older. Early\\nonset AD comprises about 5-10 % of AD cases and\\naffects people aged 30 to 60. Some cases of early onset\\nAD are inherited and are common in some families.\\nEarly-onset AD often progresses faster than the more\\ncommon late-onset type.\\nAll cases of FAD, which is relatively uncommon,\\nthat have been identified to date are the early onset\\ntype. As many as 50% of FAD cases are known to\\nbe caused by three genes located on three different\\nchromosomes. Some families have mutations in the\\nAPP gene located on chromosome 21, which causes\\nthe production of abnormal APP protein. Others\\nhave mutations in a gene called presenilin 1 located\\non chromosome 14, which causes the production of\\nabnormal presenilin 1 protein, and others have muta-\\ntions in a similar gene called presenilin 2 located\\non chromosome 1, which causes production of abnor-\\nmal presenilin 2. Presenilin 1 may be one of the\\nenzymes that clips APP into beta-amyloid; it also\\nmay be important in the synaptic connections between\\nbrain cells.\\nThere is no evidence that the mutated genes that\\nc a u s ee a r l yo n s e tF A Da l s oc a u s el a t eo n s e tA D ,b u t\\ngenetics appears to play a role in this more common\\nform of AD. Discovered by researchers at Duke\\nUniversity in the early 1990s, potentially the most\\nimportant genetic link to AD was on chromosome 19.\\nA gene on this chromosome, called APOE (apolipo-\\nprotein E), codes for a protein involved in transporting\\nlipids into neurons. APOE occurs in at least three forms\\n(alleles), called APOE e2, APOE e3, and APOE e4.\\nEach person inherits one APOE from each parent, and\\ntherefore can either have one copy of two different\\nforms, or two copies of one. The relatively rare APOE\\ne2 appears to protect some people from AD, as it seems\\nto be associated with a lower risk of AD and a later age\\nof onset if AD develops. APOE e3 is the most common\\nversion found in the general population, and only\\nappears to have a neutral role in AD. However, APOE\\ne4 appears to increase the risk of developing late onset\\nAD with the inheritance of one or two copies of APOE\\ne4.

Having APOE e4 also can lower\\nthe age of onset by as much as 17 years. However,\\nAPOE e4 only increases the risk of developing AD\\nand does not cause it, as not everyone with APOE e4\\ndevelops AD, and people without it can still have the\\ndisease. Why APOE e4 increases the chances of devel-\\noping AD is not known with certainty. However, one\\ntheory is that APOE e4 facilitates beta-amyloid buildup\\nin plaques, thus contributing to the lowering of the age\\nof onset of AD; other theories involve interactions with\\ncholesterol levels and effects on nerve cell death inde-\\npendent of its effects on plaque buildup. In 2000, four\\nnew AD-related regions in the human genome were\\nidentified, where one out of several hundred genes in\\neach of these regions may be a risk factor gene for AD.\\nThese genes, which are not yet identified, appear to\\nmake a contribution to the risk of developing late-\\nonset AD that is at least as important as APOE e4.\\nOther non-genetic factors have been studied in\\nrelation to the causes of AD. Inflammation of the\\nbrain may play a role in development of AD, and use\\nofnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\\nwere once thought to reduce the risk of developing\\nAD. Other agents once thought to reduce chances of\\ndementia are now thought to increase its risk. In 2002,\\nhormone replacement therapy(HRT), which combines\\nestrogen and progestogen, was found to double the\\nrisk of developing dementia in postmenopausal\\nwomen. Highly reactive molecular fragments called\\nfree radicals damage cells of all kinds, especially\\nbrain cells, which have smaller supplies of protective\\nantioxidants thought to protect against free radical\\ndamage. Vitamin E is one such antioxidant, and its\\nuse in AD may be of possible theoretical benefit.\\nWhile the ultimate cause or causes of Alzheimer’s\\ndisease still are unknown, there are several risk factors\\nthat increase a person’s likelihood of developing the\\ndisease. The most significant one is, of course, age;\\nolder people develop AD at much higher rates than\\nyounger ones. There is some evidence that strokes and\\nAD may be linked, with small strokes that go unde-\\ntected clinically contributing to the injury of neurons.\\nA 2003 Dutch study reported that symptomless, unno-\\nticed strokes could double the risk of AD and other\\ndementias. Blood cholesterol levels also may be\\nimportant. Scientists have shown that high blood\\ncholesterol levels in special breeds of genetically\\nengineered (transgenic) mice may increase the rate of\\nplaque deposition. There are also parallels between\\nAD and other progressive neurodegenerative disor-\\nders that cause dementia, including prion diseases,\\nParkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease.\\nNumerous epidemiological studies of populations\\nalso are being conducted to learn more about whether\\nand to what extent early life events, socioeconomic\\nfactors, and ethnicity have an impact on the develop-\\nment of AD. For example, a 2003 report showed that\\nthe more formal education a person has, the better his\\nor her memory is, despite presence of AD. Other stu-\\ndies have related education level or participation in\\nleisure activities such as playing cards or doing cross-\\nword puzzles to delayed onset of AD.\\nMany environmental factors have been suspected\\nof contributing to AD, but epidemiological popula-\\ntion studies have not borne out these links. Among\\nthese have been pollutants in drinking water, alumi-\\nnum from commercial products, and metal dental fill-\\nings. To date, none of these factors has been shown to\\ncause AD or increase its likelihood. Further research\\nmay yet turn up links to other environmental factors.\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease begin gra-\\ndually, usually with memory lapses. Occasional mem-\\nory lapses are of course common to everyone, and do\\nnot by themselves signify any change in cognitive\\nfunction. The person with AD may begin with only\\nthe routine sort of memory lapse — forgetting where\\nthe car keys are — but progress to more profound or\\ndisturbing losses, such as forgetting that he or she can\\neven drive a car. Becoming lost or disoriented on a walk\\naround the neighborhood becomes more likely as the\\ndisease progresses. A person with AD may forget the\\nnames of family members, or forget what was said at\\nthe beginning of a sentence by the time he hears the end.\\nAs AD progresses, other symptoms appear,\\nincluding inability to perform routine tasks, loss of\\njudgment, and personality or behavior changes.\\nSome people with AD have trouble sleeping and may\\nsuffer from confusion or agitation in the evening\\n(‘‘sunsetting’’ or Sundowner’s Syndrome). In some\\ncases, people with AD repeat the same ideas, move-\\nments, words, or thoughts. In the final stages people\\nmay have severe problems with eating, communicat-\\ning, and controlling their bladder and bowel functions.\\nThe Alzheimer’s Association has developed a list\\nof 10 warning signs of AD.

It is impor-\\ntant for the person with these symptoms to be evalu-\\nated by a professional who can weigh the possibility\\nthat his or her symptoms may have another cause.\\nApproximately 20% of those originally suspected of\\nhaving AD turn out to have some other disorder;\\nabout half of these cases are treatable.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is complex, and\\nmay require office visits to several different specialists\\nover several months before a diagnosis can be made.\\nWhile a confident provisional diagnosis may be made\\nin most cases after thorough testing, AD cannot be\\ndiagnosed definitively until autopsy examination of\\nthe brain for plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.\\nThe diagnosis of AD begins with a thorough\\nphysical exam and complete medical history. Except\\nin the disease’s earliest stages, accurate history from\\nfamily members or caregivers is essential. Since there\\nare both prescription and over-the-counter drugs\\nthat can cause the same mental changes as AD, a\\ncareful review of the patient’s drug, medicine, and\\nalcohol use is important. AD-like symptoms also\\ncan be provoked by other medical conditions, includ-\\ning tumors, infection, and dementia caused by mild\\nstrokes (multi-infarct dementia). These possibilities\\nmust be ruled out as well through appropriate blood\\nand urine tests, brain magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI), positron emission tomography (PET)o rs i n -\\ngle photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)\\nscans, tests of the brain’s electrical activity (electro-\\nencephalographs or EEGs), or other tests. Several\\ntypes of oral and written tests are used to aid in the\\nAD diagnosis and to follow its progression, including\\ntests of mental status, functional abilities, memory,\\nand concentration. Still, the neurologic exam is\\nnormal in most patients in early stages.\\nOne of the most important parts of the diagnostic\\nprocess is to evaluate the patient for depression and\\ndelirium, since each of these can be present with AD, or\\nmay be mistaken for it. (Delirium involves a decreased\\nconsciousness or awareness of one’s environment.)\\nDepression and memory loss both are common\\nin the elderly, and the combination of the often can\\nbe mistaken for AD. On the other hand, depression\\ncan be a risk factor for AD. A 2003 study showed that\\na history of depressive symptoms can be associated\\nwith nearly twice the risk of eventually developing\\nAD. Depression can be treated with drugs, although\\nsome antidepressants can worsen dementia if it is\\npresent, further complicating both diagnosis and\\ntreatment.\\nAn early and accurate diagnosis of AD is impor-\\ntant in developing strategies for managing symptoms\\nand for helping patients and their families planning\\nfor the future and pursuing care options while the\\npatient can still take part in the decision-making\\nprocess.\\nA genetic test for the APOE e4 gene is available,\\nbut is not used for diagnosis, since possessing even two\\ncopies does not ensure that a person will develop AD.\\nIn addition, access to genetic information could affect\\nthe insurability of a patient if disclosed, and also affect\\nemployment status and legal rights.\\nTreatment\\nAlzheimer’s disease is presently incurable. Recent\\nreports show that prompt intervention can slow decline\\nfrom AD. The use of medications mentioned below as\\nearly as possible in the course of AD can help people\\nwith the disease maintain independent function as long\\nas possible. The remaining treatment for a person with\\nAD is good nursing care, providing both physical and\\nemotional support for a person who is gradually able to\\ndo less and less for himself, and whose behavior is\\nbecoming more and more erratic. Modifications of the\\nhome to increase safety and security often are neces-\\nsary. The caregiver also needs support to prevent anger,\\ndespair, and burnout from becoming overwhelming.\\nBecoming familiar with the issues likely to lie ahead,\\nand considering the appropriate financial and legal\\nissues early on, can help both the patient and family\\ncope with the difficult process of the disease. Regular\\nmedical care by a practitioner with a non-defeatist\\nattitude toward AD is important so that illnesses such\\nas urinary or respiratory infections can be diagnosed\\nand treated properly, rather than being incorrectly\\nattributed to the inevitable decline seen in AD.\\nPeople with AD often are depressed or anxious,\\nand may suffer from sleeplessness, poornutrition, and\\ngeneral poor health. Each of these conditions is trea-\\ntable to some degree.

Other psychiatric symptoms, such as depres-\\nsion, anxiety,hallucinations (seeing or hearing things\\nthat aren’t there), anddelusions (false beliefs) may be\\ntreated with drugs if necessary.\\nDrugs\\nAs of 2003, four drugs—tacrine (Cognex), done-\\npezil hydrochloride (Aricept), and rivastigmine\\n(Exelon)—have been approved by the FDA for its\\ntreatment. Tacrine has been shown to be effective for\\nimproving memory skills, but only in patients with\\nmild-to-moderate AD, and even then in less than half\\nof those who take it. Its beneficial effects are usually\\nmild and temporary, but it may delay the need for\\nnursing home admission. The most significant side\\neffect is an increase in a liver enzyme known as alanine\\naminotransferase, or ALT. Patients taking tacrine\\nmust have a weekly blood test to monitor their ALT\\nlevels. Other frequent side effects include nausea,\\nvomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain,indigestion,a n d\\nskin rash. The cost of tacrine was about $125 per\\nmonth in early 1998, with additional costs for the\\nweekly blood monitoring. Despite its high cost, tacrine\\nappears to be cost-effective for those who respond to\\nit, since it may decrease the number of months a\\npatient needs nursing care. Donepezil is the drug\\nmost commonly used to treat mild to moderate symp-\\ntoms of AD, although it only helps some patients for\\nperiods of time ranging from months to about two\\nyears. Donepezil has two advantages over tacrine: it\\nhas fewer side effects, and it can be given once daily\\nrather than three times daily. Donepezil does not\\nappear to affect liver enzymes, and therefore does\\nnot require weekly blood tests. The frequency of\\nabdominal side effects is also lower. The monthly\\ncost is approximately the same. Rivastigmine,\\napproved for use in April of 2000, has been shown to\\nimprove the ability of patients to carry out daily activi-\\nties, such as eating and dressing, decrease behavioral\\nsymptoms such as delusions and agitation, and improve\\ncognitive functions such as thinking, memory, and\\nspeaking. The cost is similar to those of the other\\ntwo drugs. However, none of these three drugs stops\\nor reverses the progression of AD. Galantamine\\n(Reminyl) works in the early and moderates stages\\nof AD. It has fewer side effects than other drugs,\\nwith the exception of donepezil and must be taken\\ntwice a day. Three other drugs were being tested for\\nAD treatment in mid-2003.\\nEstrogen, the female sex hormone, is widely pre-\\nscribed for post-menopausal women to preventosteo-\\nporosis.

However, an important study\\npublished in 2003 showed that NSAIDs were not effec-\\ntive in preventing or slowing the progression of AD.\\nThe study authors recommended that people stop\\ntaking NSAIDs to slow dementia.\\nAntioxidants, which act to inhibit and protect\\nagainst oxidative damage caused by free radicals, have\\nbeen shown to inhibit toxic effects of beta-amyloid in\\ntissue culture. Therefore, research is being conducted\\nto see whether antioxidants may delay or prevent AD.\\nAnother antioxidant, vitamin E, is also thought\\nto delay AD onset. Hoever, it is not yet clear whether\\nthis is due to the specific action of vitamin E on brain\\ncells, or to an increase in the overall health of those\\ntaking it.\\nDrugs such as antidepressants, anti-psychotics,\\nand sedatives are used to treat the behavioral symp-\\ntoms (agitation, aggression, wandering, and sleep dis-\\norders) of AD.

In all cases, a person diagnosed with\\nAD should no longer be allowed to drive, because of\\nthe increased potential for accidents and the increased\\nlikelihood of wandering very far from home while\\ndisoriented. In the home, simple measures such as\\ngrab bars in the bathroom, bed rails on the bed, and\\neasily negotiable passageways can greatly increase\\nsafety.

Odle\\nAmbiguous genitals see Intersex states\\nAmblyopia\\nDefinition\\nAmblyopia is an uncorrectable decrease in vision in\\none or both eyes with no apparent structural abnor-\\nmality seen to explain it. It is a diagnosis of exclusion,\\nmeaning that when a decrease in vision is detected,\\nother causes must be ruled out. Once no other cause is\\nfound, amblyopia is the diagnosis. Generally, a differ-\\nence of two lines or more (on an eye-chart test of visual\\nacuity) between the two eyes or a best corrected vision\\nof 20/30 or worse would be defined as amblyopia. For\\nexample, if someone has 20/20 vision with the right eye\\nand only 20/40 with the left, and the left eye cannot\\nachieve better vision with corrective lenses, the left eye\\nis said to be amblyopic.\\nDescription\\nLazy eye is a common non-medical term used to\\ndescribe amblyopia because the eye with poorer vision\\ndoesn’t seem to be doing its job of seeing. Amblyopia\\nis the most common cause of impaired vision in child-\\nren, affecting nearly three out of every 100 people or\\n2-4% of the population. Vision is a combination of the\\nclarity of the images of the eyes (visual acuity) and the\\nprocessing of those images by the brain. If the images\\nproduced by the two eyes are substantially different,\\nthe brain may not be able to fuse the images. Instead of\\nseeing two different images or double vision (diplo-\\npia), the brain suppresses the blurrier image. This\\nsuppression can lead to amblyopia. During the first\\nfew years of life, preferring one eye over the other may\\nlead to poor visual development in the blurrier eye.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSome of the major causes of amblyopia are as\\nfollows:\\n/C15Strabismus. A misalignment of the eyes (strabismus)\\nis the most common cause of functional amblyopia.\\nThe two eyes are looking in two different directions at\\nthe same time. The brain is sent two different images\\nand this causes confusion. Images from the misaligned\\nor ‘‘crossed’’ eye are turned off to avoid double vision.\\n/C15Anisometropia. This is another type of functional\\namblyopia. In this case, there is a difference of refrac-\\ntive states between the two eyes (in other words, a\\ndifference of prescriptions between the two eyes).\\nFor example, one eye may be more nearsighted than\\nthe other eye, or one eye may be farsighted and the\\nother eye nearsighted. Because the brain cannot fuse\\nthe two dissimilar images, the brain will suppress the\\nblurrier image, causing the eye to become amblyopic.\\n/C15Cataract. Clouding of the lens of the eye will cause\\nthe image to be blurrier than the other eye. The brain\\n‘‘prefers’’ the clearer image. The eye with the cataract\\nmay become amblyopic.\\n/C15Ptosis. This is the drooping of the upper eyelid. If\\nlight cannot enter the eye because of the drooping lid,\\nthe eye is essentially not being used. This can lead to\\namblyopia.\\n/C15Nutrition. A type of organic amblyopia in which\\nnutritional deficiencies or chemical toxicity may\\nresult in amblyopia. Alcohol, tobacco, or a deficiency\\nin the Bvitamins may result in toxic amblyopia.\\n/C15Heredity. Amblyopia can run in families.\\nBarring the presence of strabismus or ptosis,\\nchildren may or may not show signs of amblyopia.\\n148 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAmblyopia'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 178, 'page_label': '179'}, page_content='Children may hold their heads at an angle while trying\\nto favor the eye with normal vision.

If an infant’s good eye is covered, the child\\nmay cry.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause children with outwardly normal eyes may\\nhave amblyopia, it is important to have regular vision\\nscreenings performed for all children. While there is\\nsome controversy regarding the age children should\\nhave their first vision examination, their eyes can, in\\nactuality, be examined at any age, even at one day of life.\\nSome recommend that children have their vision\\nchecked by their pediatrician, family physician,\\nophthalmologist, or optometrist at or before six\\nmonths of age. Others recommend testing by at least\\nthe child’s fourth birthday. There may be a ‘‘critical\\nperiod’’ in the development of vision, and amblyopia\\nmay not be treatable after age eight or nine. The earlier\\namblyopia is found, the better the possible outcome.\\nMost physicians test vision as part of a child’s medical\\nexamination. If there is any sign of an eye problem,\\nthey may refer a child to an eye specialist.\\nThere are objective methods, such as retinoscopy,\\nto measure the refractive status of the eyes. This can\\nhelp determine anisometropia. In retinoscopy, a hand-\\nheld instrument is used to shine a light in the child’s (or\\ninfant’s) eyes. Using hand-held lenses, a rough pre-\\nscription can be obtained. Visual acuity can be deter-\\nmined using a variety of methods. Many different eye\\ncharts are available (e.g., tumbling E, pictures, or\\nletters). In amblyopia, single letters are easier to\\nrecognize than when a whole line is shown. This is\\ncalled the ‘‘crowding effect’’ and helps in diagnosing\\namblyopia. Neutral density filters may also be held\\nover the eye to aid in the diagnosis. Sometimes visual\\nfields to determine defects in the area of vision will be\\nperformed. Color vision testing may also be per-\\nformed. Again, it must be emphasized that amblyopia\\nis a diagnosis of exclusion. Visual or life-threatening\\nproblems can also cause a decrease in vision. An exam-\\nination of the eyes and visual system is very important\\nwhen there is an unexplained decrease in vision.\\nTreatment\\nThe primary treatment for amblyopia is occlusion\\ntherapy. It is important to alternate patching the good\\neye (forcing the amblyopic eye to work) and the\\namblyopic eye. If the good eye is constantly patched,\\nit too may become amblyopic because of disuse. The\\ntreatment plan should be discussed with the doctor to\\nfully understand how long the patch will be on. When\\npatched, eye exercises may be prescribed to force the\\namblyopic eye to focus and work. This is called vision\\ntherapy orvision training (eye exercises). Even after\\nvision has been restored in the weak eye, part-time\\npatching may be required over a period of years to\\nmaintain the improvement.\\nWhile patching is necessary to get the amblyopic\\neye to work, it is just as important to correct the reason\\nfor the amblyopia.

Persons with amebiasis may\\nexperience a wide range of symptoms, includingdiar-\\nrhea, fever, and cramps. The disease may also affect\\nthe intestines, liver, or other parts of the body.\\nDescription\\nAmebiasis, also known as amebicdysentery, is one\\nof the most common parasitic diseases occurring in\\nhumans, with an estimated 500 million new cases each\\nyear. It occurs most frequently in tropical and subtro-\\npical areas where living conditions are crowded, with\\ninadequate sanitation. Although most cases of ame-\\nbiasis occur in persons who carry the disease but do\\nnot exhibit any symptoms (asymptomatic), as many as\\n100,000 people die of amebiasis each year. In the\\nUnited States, between 1 and 5% of the general popu-\\nlation will develop amebiasis in any given year, while\\nmale homosexuals, migrant workers, institutionalized\\npeople, and recent immigrants develop amebiasis at a\\nhigher rate.\\nHuman beings are the only known host of the\\namebiasis organism, and all groups of people, regardless\\nof age or sex, can become affected. Amebiasis is primar-\\nily spread in food and water that has been contaminated\\nby human feces but is also spread by person-to-person\\ncontact. The number of cases is typically limited, but\\nregional outbreaks can occur in areas where human\\nfeces are used as fertilizer for crops, or in cities with\\nwater supplies contaminated with human feces.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRecently, it has been discovered that persons\\nwith symptom-causing amebiasis are infected with\\nEntamoeba histolytica, and those individuals who\\nexhibit no symptoms are actually infected with an\\nalmost identical-looking ameba calledEntamoeba\\ndispar. During their life cycles, the amebas exist in\\ntwo very different forms: the infective cyst or\\ncapsuled form, which cannot move but can survive\\noutside the human body because of its protective\\ncovering, and the disease-producing form, the\\ntrophozoite, which although capable of moving, can-\\nnot survive once excreted in the feces and, therefore,\\ncannot infect others. The disease is most commonly\\ntransmitted when a person eats food or drinks water\\ncontainingE. histolytica cysts from human feces. In\\nthe digestive tract the cysts are transported to the\\nintestine where the walls of the cysts are broken\\nopen by digestive secretions, releasing the mobile\\ntrophozoites. Once released within the intestine, the\\ntrophozoites multiply by feeding on intestinal bac-\\nteria or by invading the lining of the large intestine.\\nWithin the lining of the large intestine, the\\ntrophozoites secrete a substance that destroys intest-\\ninal tissue and creates a distinctive bottle-shaped\\nsore (ulcer). The trophozoites may remain inside the\\nintestine, in the intestinal wall, or may break through\\n150 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAmebiasis'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 180, 'page_label': '181'}, page_content='the intestinal wall and be carried by the blood to the\\nliver, lungs, brain, or other organs. Trophozoites that\\nremain in the intestines eventually form new cysts\\nthat are carried through the digestive tract and\\nexcreted in the feces. Under favorable temperature\\nand humidity conditions, the cysts can survive in\\nsoil or water for weeks to months, ready to begin\\nthe cycle again.\\nAlthough 90% of cases of amebiasis in the United\\nStates are mild, pregnant women, children under two\\nyears of age, the elderly, malnourished individuals,\\nand people whose immune systems may be compressed,\\nsuch ascancer or AIDS patients and those individuals\\ntaking prescription medications that suppress the\\nimmune system, are at a greater risk for developing a\\nsevere infection.\\nThe signs and symptoms of amebiasis vary\\naccording to the location and severity of the infection\\nand are classified as follows:\\nIntestinal amebiasis\\nIntestinal amebiasis can be subdivided into several\\ncategories:\\nASYMPTOMATIC INFECTION. Most persons with\\namebiasis have no noticeable symptoms. Even though\\nthese individuals may not feel ill, they are still capable\\nof infecting others by person-to-person contact or by\\ncontaminating food or water with cysts that others\\nmay ingest, for example, by preparing food with\\nunwashed hands.\\nCHRONIC NON-DYSENTERIC INFECTION. Indivi-\\nduals may experience symptoms over a long period\\nof time during a chronic amebiasis infection and\\nexperience recurrent episodes of diarrhea that last\\nfrom one to four weeks and recur over a period of\\nyears. These patients may also suffer from abdominal\\ncramps,fatigue, and weight loss.\\nAMEBIC DYSENTERY. In severe cases of intestinal\\namebiasis, the organism invades the lining of the\\nintestine, producing sores(ulcers), bloody diarrhea,\\nsevere abdominal cramps, vomiting,c h i l l s ,a n d\\nfevers as high as 104-1058F (40-40.68C). In addition,\\nac a s eo fa c u t ea m e b i cd y s entery may cause compli-\\ncations, including inflam mation of the appendix\\n(appendicitis ), a tear in the intestinal wall (perfora-\\ntion), or a sudden, severe inflammation of the colon\\n(fulminating colitis).\\nAMEBOMA. An ameboma is a mass of tissue in the\\nbowel that is formed by the amebiasis organism. It can\\nresult from either chronic intestinal infection or acute\\namebic dysentery.

In the United States,\\namebic liver abscesses occur most frequently in young\\nHispanic adults. An amebic liver abscess can result\\nfrom direct infection of the liver byE. histolytica or as\\na complication of intestinal amebiasis. Patients with an\\namebic abscess of the liver complain ofpain in the chest\\nor abdomen, fever,nausea, and tenderness on the right\\nside directly above the liver.\\nOther forms of extraintestinal amebiasis, though\\nrare, include infections of the lungs, chest cavity,\\nbrain, or genitals. These are extremely serious and\\nhave a relatively high mortality rate.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of amebiasis is complicated, partly\\nbecause the disease can affect several areas of the\\nbody and can range from exhibiting few, if any, symp-\\ntoms to being severe, or even life-threatening. In most\\ncases, a physician will consider a diagnosis of amebia-\\nsis when a patient has a combination of symptoms, in\\nparticular, diarrhea and a possible history of recent\\nexposure to amebiasis through travel, contact with\\ninfected persons, or anal intercourse.\\nIt is vital to distinguish between amebiasis and\\nanother disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\\nthat produces similar symptoms because, if diagnosed\\nincorrectly, drugs that are given to treat IBD can\\nencourage the growth and spread of the amebiasis\\norganism. Because of the serious consequences of\\nmisdiagnosis, potential cases of IBD must be con-\\nfirmed with multiple stool samples and blood tests,\\nand a procedure involving a visual inspection of the\\nintestinal wall using a thin lighted, tubular instrument\\n(sigmoidoscopy) to rule out amebiasis.\\nA diagnosis of amebiasis may be confirmed by one\\nor more tests, depending on the location of the disease.\\nStool examination\\nThis test involves microscopically examining a\\nstool sample for the presence of cysts and/or tropho-\\nzoites ofE. histolytica and not one of the many other\\nintestinal amebas that are often found but that do not\\ncause disease. A series of three stool tests is approxi-\\nmately 90% accurate in confirming a diagnosis of\\namebic dysentery. Unfortunately, however, the stool\\ntest is not useful in diagnosing amebomas or extra-\\nintestinal infections.\\nSigmoidoscopy\\nSigmoidoscopy is a useful diagnostic procedure in\\nwhich a thin, flexible, lighted instrument, called a\\nsigmoidoscope, is used to visually examine the lower\\npart of the large intestine for amebic ulcers and take\\ntissue or fluid samples from the intestinal lining.\\nBlood tests\\nAlthough tests designed to detect a specific\\nprotein produced in response to amebiasis infection\\n(antibody) are capable of detecting only about 10%\\nof cases of mild amebiasis, these tests are extremely\\nuseful in confirming 95% of dysentery diagnoses\\nand 98% of liver abscess diagnoses. Blood serum will\\nusually test positive for antibody within a week of\\nsymptom onset. Blood testing, however, cannot\\nalways distinguish between a current or past infection\\nsince the antibodies may be detectable in the blood\\nfor as long as 10 years following initial infection.\\nImaging studies\\nA number of sophisticated imaging techniques,\\nsuch as computed tomography scans (CT), magnetic\\nresonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound, can be\\nused to determine whether a liver abscess is present.\\nOnce located, a physician may then use a fine needle\\nto withdraw a sample of tissue to determine whether\\nthe abscess is indeed caused by an amebic infection.\\nTreatment\\nAsymptomatic or mild cases of amebiasis may\\nrequire no treatment. However, because of the\\npotential for disease spread, amebiasis is generally\\ntreated with a medication to kill the disease-causing\\namebas. More severe cases of amebic dysentery are\\nadditionally treated by replacing lost fluid and\\nblood. Patients with an amebic liver abscess will\\nalso require hospitalization and bed rest. For those\\ncases of extraintestinal amebiasis, treatment can be\\ncomplicated because different drugs may be required\\nto eliminate the parasite, based on the location of\\nthe infection within the body.

Many women\\nmiss a period occasionally. Amenorrhea occurs if a\\nwoman misses three or more periods in a row.\\nDescription\\nThe absence of menstrual periods is a symptom,\\nnot a disease. While the average age that menstruation\\nbegins is 12, the range varies. The incidence of primary\\namenorrhea in the United States is just 2.5%.\\nSome female athletes who participate in rowing,\\nlong distance running, and cycling, may notice a few\\nmissed periods. Women athletes at a particular risk for\\ndeveloping amenorrhea include ballerinas and gym-\\nnasts, who typically exercise strenuously and eat poorly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAmenorrhea can have many causes. Primary ame-\\nnorrhea can be the result of hormonal imbalances,\\npsychiatric disorders, eating disorders, malnutrition,\\nexcessive thinness or fatness, rapid weight loss, body\\nfat content too low, and excessive physical condition-\\ning.

Tests are most\\ncommonly done on newborns. Two tests are available,\\none using a blood sample and the other a urine sample.\\nPurpose\\nAmino acid disorder screening is done in new-\\nborns, and sometimes children and adults, to detect\\ninborn errors in metabolism of amino acids. Twenty of\\nthe 100 known amino acids are the main building\\nblocks for human proteins. Proteins regulate every\\naspect of cellular function. Of these 20 amino acids,\\nten are not made by the body and must be acquired\\nthrough diet. Congenital (present at birth) enzyme defi-\\nciencies that affect amino acid metabolism or congenital\\nabnormalities in the amino acid transport system of\\nthe kidneys creates a condition called aminoaciduria.\\nScreening is especially important in newborns.\\nSome congenital amino acid metabolic defects cause\\nmental retardation that can prevented with prompt\\ntreatment of the newborn. One of the best known\\nexamples of this isphenylketonuria (PKU). This is an\\ngenetic error in metabolism of phenylalanine, an\\namino acid found in milk. Individuals with PKU do\\nnot produce the enzyme necessary to break down\\nphenylalanine.\\nPKU occurs in about one out of 16,000 live births\\nin the United States, but is more prevalent in cauca-\\nsians and less prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews and African\\nAmericans. Newborns in the United States are routi-\\nnely screened for PKU by a blood test.\\nThere are two types of aminoacidurias. Primary\\nor overflow aminoaciduria results from deficiencies in\\nthe enzymes necessary to metabolize amino acids.\\nOverflow aminoaciduria is best detected by a blood\\nplasma test.\\nSecondary or renal aminoaciduria occurs because\\nof a congenital defect in the amino acid transport\\nsystem in the tubules of the kidneys. This produces\\nincreased amino acids in the urine. Blood and urine\\ntest in combination are used to determine if the ami-\\nnoaciduria is of the overflow or renal type. Urine tests\\nare also used to monitor specific amino acid disorders.\\nNewborns are screened for amino acid disorders.\\nYoung children with acidosis (accumulation of acid\\nin the body), severevomiting and diarrhea, or urine\\nwith an abnormal color or odor, are also screened\\nwith a urine test for specific amino acid levels.\\nPrecautions\\nBoth blood and urine tests are simple tests that\\ncan be done in a doctor’s office or clinic.

This\\ngroup of antibiotics includes at least eight drugs:\\namikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, netil-\\nmicin, paromomycin, streptomycin, and tobramycin.\\nAll of these drugs have the same basic chemical\\nstructure.\\nPurpose\\nAminoglycosides are primarily used to combat\\ninfections due to aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria.\\nThese bacteria can be identified by their reaction to\\nGram’s stain. In Gram’s staining, a film of material\\ncontaining the possible bacteria is placed on a glass\\nslide and dried. The slide is stained with crystal violet\\nfor one minute, cleaned off with water and then placed\\ninto a solution of Gram’s iodine solution for one\\nminute. The iodine solution is rinsed off and the slide\\nis immersed in 95% ethyl alcohol. The slide is then\\nstained again with reddish carbolfuchsin or safranine\\nfor 30 seconds, rinsed in water, dried and examined.\\nGram-positive bacteria retain the violet purple stain.\\nGram-negative bacteria accept the red stain. Bacteria\\nthat can successfully be combated with aminoglyco-\\nsides includePseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and\\nEnterobacter species, among others. Aminoglycosides\\nare also effective against mycobacteria, the bacteria\\nresponsible fortuberculosis.\\nThe aminoglycosides can be used against certain\\nGram-positive bacteria, but are not typically\\nemployed because other antibiotics are more effective\\nand have fewer side effects. Aminoglycosides are inef-\\nfective against anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that can-\\nnot grow in the presence of oxygen), viruses, and\\nfungi. And only one aminoglycoside, paromomycin,\\nis used against parasitic infection.\\nLike all other antibiotics, aminoglycosides are not\\neffective againstinfluenza, thecommon cold, or other\\nviral infections.\\nPrecautions\\nPre-existing medical conditions–such as kidney\\ndisease, eighth cranial nerve disease, myasthenia\\ngravis, and Parkinson’s disease–should be discussed\\nprior to taking any aminoglycosides. Pregnant\\nwomen are usually advised against taking aminogly-\\ncosides, because their infants may suffer damage to\\ntheir hearing, kidneys, or sense of balance. However,\\nthose factors need to be considered alongside the\\nthreat to the mother’s health and life in cases of\\nserious infection.

The route of drug admin-\\nistration depends on the type and location of the\\ninfection being treated. The typical routes of admin-\\nistration are by intramuscular (injection into a mus-\\ncle) or intravenous injection (injection into a vein),\\nirrigation, topical skin application, or inhalation.\\nIf the infection being treated involves the central\\nnervous system, the drug can be injected into the\\nspinal canal.\\nThe bactericidal ability of aminoglycosides has\\nnot been fully explained. It is known that the drug\\nattaches to a bacterial cell wall and is drawn into the\\ncell via channels made up of the protein, porin. Once\\ninside the cell, the aminoglycoside attaches to the cell’s\\nribosomes. Ribosomes are the intracellular structures\\nresponsible for manufacturing proteins. This attach-\\nment either shuts down protein production or causes\\nthe cell to produce abnormal, ineffective proteins. The\\nbacterial cell cannot survive with this impediment.\\nAntibiotic treatment using aminoglycosides may\\npair the drug with a second type of antibiotic, usually\\na beta-lactam or vancomycin, administered sepa-\\nrately. Beta-lactams disrupt the integrity of the bac-\\nteria cell wall, making it more porous. The increased\\nporosity allows more of the aminoglycoside into the\\nbacteria cell.\\nTraditionally, aminoglycosides were administered\\nat even doses given throughout the day.

Damage to the middle ear may\\nresult inhearing lossor tinnitus. Neomycin, kanamycin,\\nand amikacin are the most likely to cause problems with\\nhearing, and streptomycin and gentamicin carry the\\ngreatest risk of causing vertigo and loss of balance.\\nKidney damage, apparent with changes in urination\\nfrequency or urine production, is most likely precipi-\\ntated by neomycin, tobramycin, and gentamicin.\\nYoung children and the elderly are at the greatest\\nrisk of suffering side effects. Excessive dosage or poor\\nclearance of the drug from the body can be injurious at\\nany age.\\nLess common side effects include skinrashes and\\nitching. Very rarely, certain aminoglycosides may\\ncause difficulty in breathing, weakness, or drowsiness.\\nGentamicin, when injected, may cause leg cramps,\\nskin rash,fever, or seizures.\\nIf side effects linger or become worse after medi-\\ncation is stopped, it is advisable to seek medical advice.\\nSide effects that may be of concern includetinnitus or\\nloss of hearing, dizziness or loss of balance, changes in\\nurination frequency or urine production, increased\\nthirst, appetite loss, andnausea or vomiting.\\nNormal results\\nAt the proper dosage and in the presence of gram-\\nnegative enteric (intestinal) bacteria, aminoglycosides\\nare very effective in treating an infection.\\nAbnormal results\\nIn some cases, bacteria are resistant to antibiotics\\nthat would normally kill them.

Memory\\nloss may result from two-sided (bilateral) damage to\\nparts of the brain vital for memory storage, proces-\\nsing, or recall (the limbic system, including the hippo-\\ncampus in the medial temporal lobe).\\nDescription\\nAmnesia can be a symptom of several neurode-\\ngenerative diseases; however, people whose primary\\nsymptom is memory loss (amnesiacs), typically remain\\nlucid and retain their sense of self. They may even be\\naware that they suffer from a memory disorder.\\nPeople who experience amnesia have been instru-\\nmental in helping brain researchers determine how\\nthe brain processes memory. Until the early 1970s,\\nresearchers viewed memory as a single entity.\\nMemory of new experiences, motor skills, past events,\\nand previous conditioning were grouped together in\\none system that relied on a specific area of the brain.\\nIf all memory were stored in the same way, it would\\nbe reasonable to deduce that damage to the specific\\nbrain area would cause complete memory loss. How-\\never, studies of amnesiacs counter that theory. Such\\nresearch demonstrates that the brain has multiple sys-\\ntems for processing, storing, and drawing on memory.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAmnesia has several root causes. Most are trace-\\nable to brain injury related to physical trauma, disease,\\ninfection, drug and alcoholabuse, or reduced blood\\nflow to the brain (vascular insufficiency). In Wernicke-\\nKorsakoff syndrome, for example, damage to the\\nmemory centers of the brain results from the use of\\nalcohol ormalnutrition. Infections that damage brain\\ntissue, including encephalitis and herpes, can also\\ncause amnesia. If the amnesia is thought to be of\\npsychological origin, it is termed psychogenic.\\nThere are at least three general types of amnesia:\\n/C15Anterograde. This form of amnesia follows brain\\ntrauma and is characterized by the inability to\\nremember new information. Recent experiences and\\nshort-term memory disappear, but victims can recall\\nevents prior to the trauma with clarity.\\n/C15Retrograde. In some ways, this form of amnesia is\\nthe opposite of anterograde amnesia: the victim can\\nrecall events that occurred after a trauma, but cannot\\nremember previously familiar information or the\\nevents preceding the trauma.\\n/C15Transient global amnesia. This type of amnesia has\\nno consistently identifiable cause, but researchers\\nhave suggested that migraines or transient ischemic\\nattacks may be the trigger. (Atransient ischemic\\nattack, sometimes called ‘‘a small stroke,’’ occurs\\nwhen a blockage in an artery temporarily blocks\\noff blood supply to part of the brain.) A victim\\nexperiences sudden confusion and forgetfulness.\\nAttacks can be as brief as 30-60 minutes or can\\nlast up to 24 hours. In severe attacks, a person is\\ncompletely disoriented and may experience retro-\\ngrade amnesia that extends back several years.\\nWhile very frightening for the patient, transient\\nglobal amnesia generally has an excellent prognosis\\nfor recovery.\\nAmygdalaHippocampus\\nMemory loss may result from bilateral damage to the limbic\\nsystem of the brain responsible for memory storage, proces-\\nsing, and recall.(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 159\\nAmnesia'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 189, 'page_label': '190'}, page_content='Diagnosis\\nIn diagnosing amnesia and its cause, doctors look\\nat several factors. During aphysical examination,t h e\\ndoctor inquires about recent traumas or illnesses, drug\\nand medication history, and checks the patient’s general\\nhealth. Psychological exams may be ordered to deter-\\nmine the extent of amnesia and the memory system\\naffected. The doctor may also order imaging tests such\\nasmagnetic resonance imaging(MRI) to reveal whether\\nthe brain has been damaged, and blood work to exclude\\ntreatable metabolic causes or chemical imbalances.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment depends on the root cause of amnesia\\nand is handled on an individual basis. Regardless of\\ncause, cognitiverehabilitationmay be helpful in learning\\nstrategies to cope with memory impairment.\\nPrognosis\\nSome types of amnesia, such as transient global\\namnesia, are completely resolved and there is no per-\\nmanent loss of memory. Others, such as Korsakoff\\nsyndrome, associated with prolonged alcohol abuse\\nor amnesias caused by severe brain injury, may be\\npermanent. Depending on the degree of amnesia and\\nits cause, victims may be able to lead relatively normal\\nlives. Amnesiacs can learn through therapy to rely on\\nother memory systems to compensate for what is lost.\\nPrevention\\nAmnesia is only preventable in so far as brain\\ninjury can be prevented or minimized. Common\\nsense approaches include wearing a helmet when bicy-\\ncling or participating in potentially dangerous sports,\\nusing automobile seat belts, and avoiding excessive\\nalcohol or drug use. Brain infections should be treated\\nswiftly and aggressively to minimize the damage due\\nto swelling.

By 1997, approxi-\\nmately 800 different diagnostic tests were available,\\nmost of them for hereditary genetic disorders such\\nas Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell anemia,hemophilia,\\nmuscular dystrophyand cystic fibrosis.\\nAmniocentesis, often called amnio, is recom-\\nmended for women who will be older than 35 on\\ntheir due-date. It is also recommended for women\\nwho have already borne children with birth defects,\\nor when either of the parents has a family history of a\\nbirth defect for which a diagnostic test is available.\\nAnother reason for the procedure is to confirm indica-\\ntions of Down syndrome and certain other defects\\nwhich may have shown up previously during routine\\nmaternal blood screening.\\nThe risk of bearing a child with a nonhereditary\\ngenetic defect such as Down syndrome is directly\\nrelated to a woman’s age–the older the woman, the\\ngreater the risk. Thirty-five is the recommended age to\\nbegin amnio testing because that is the age at which the\\nrisk of carrying a fetus with such a defect roughly\\nequals the risk of miscarriage caused by the proce-\\ndure–about one in 200. At age 25, the risk of giving\\nbirth to a child with this type of defect is about one in\\n1,400; by age 45 it increases to about one in 20.

Important, also, isthe fact that elective abor-\\ntions are safer and less controversial the earlier they\\nare performed.\\nPrecautions\\nAs an invasive surgical procedure, amnio poses a\\nreal, although small, risk to the health of a fetus.\\nParents must weigh the potential value of the knowl-\\nedge gained, or indeed the reassurance that all is well,\\nagainst the small risk of damaging what is in all pro-\\nbability a normal fetus. The serious emotional and\\nethical dilemmas that adverse test results can bring\\nmust also be considered. The decision to undergo\\namnio is always a matter of personal choice.\\nDescription\\nThe word amniocentesis literally means ‘‘puncture\\nof the amnion,’’ the thin-walled sac of fluid in which a\\ndeveloping fetus is suspended during pregnancy.\\nDuring the sampling procedure, the obstetrician inserts\\na very fine needle through the woman’s abdomen into\\nthe uterus and amniotic sac and withdraws appro-\\nximately one ounce of amniotic fluid for testing. The\\nKEY TERMS\\nAlpha-fetoprotein (AFP)— A protein normally pro-\\nduced by the liver of a fetus and detectable in mater-\\nnal blood samples. AFP screening measures the\\namount of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood. Levels\\noutside the norm may indicate fetal defects.\\nAnencephaly— A hereditary defect resulting in the\\npartial to complete absence of a brain and spinal\\ncord. It is fatal.\\nChorionic villus sampling (CVS)— A procedure\\nsimilar to amniocentesis, except that cells are\\ntaken from the chorionic membrane for testing.\\nThese cells, called chorionic villus cells, eventually\\nbecome the placenta. The samples are collected\\neither through the abdomen, as in amnio, or\\nthrough the vagina. CVS can be done earlier in the\\npregnancy than amnio, but carries a somewhat\\nhigher risk.\\nChromosome— Chromosomes are the strands of\\ngenetic material in a cell that occur in nearly\\nidentical pairs. Normal human cells contain 23\\nchromosome pairs–one in each pair inherited\\nfrom the mother, and one from the father. Every\\nhuman cell contains the exact same set of\\nchromosomes.\\nDown syndrome— The most prevalent of a class of\\ngenetic defects known as trisomies, in which cells\\ncontain three copies of certain chromosomes rather\\nthan the usual two. Down syndrome, or trisomy 21,\\nusually results from three copies of chromosome 21.\\nGenetic— The term refers to genes, the basic units of\\nbiological heredity, which are contained on the\\nchromosomes, and contain chemical instructions\\nwhich direct the development and functioning of\\nan individual.\\nHereditary— Something which is inherited–passed\\ndown from parents to offspring. In biology and med-\\nicine, the word pertains to inherited genetic\\ncharacteristics.\\nMaternal blood screening— Maternal blood screen-\\ning is normally done early in pregnancy to test for a\\nvariety of conditions. Abnormal amounts of certain\\nproteins in a pregnant woman’s blood raise the prob-\\nability of fetal defects. Amniocentesis is recom-\\nmended if such a probability occurs.\\nTay-Sachs disease— An inherited disease prevalent\\namong the Ashkenazi Jewish population of the\\nUnited States. Infants with the disease are unable to\\nprocess a certain type of fat which accumulates in\\nnerve and brain cells, causing mental and physical\\nretardation, and death by age four.\\nUltrasound— A technique which uses high-\\nfrequency sound waves to create a visual image (a\\nsonogram) of soft tissues. The technique is routinely\\nused in prenatal care and diagnosis.\\n162 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAmniocentesis'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 192, 'page_label': '193'}, page_content='relatively painless procedure is performed on an out-\\npatient basis, sometimes usinglocal anesthesia.\\nThe physician uses ultrasound images to guide\\nneedle placement and collect the sample, thereby\\nminimizing the risk of fetal injury and the need for\\nrepeated needle insertions. Once the sample is col-\\nlected, the woman can return home after a brief\\nobservation period. She may be instructed to rest\\nfor the first 24 hours and to avoid heavy lifting for\\ntwo days.\\nThe sample of amniotic fluid is sent to a labora-\\ntory where fetal cells contained in the fluid are isolated\\nand grown in order to provide enough genetic material\\nfor testing. This takes about seven to 14 days. The\\nmaterial is then extracted and treated so that visual\\nexamination for defects can be made. For some dis-\\norders, like Tay-Sachs, the simple presence of a telltale\\nchemical compound in the amniotic fluid is enough to\\nconfirm a diagnosis. Depending on the specific tests\\nordered, and the skill of the lab conducting them, all\\nthe results are available between one and four weeks\\nafter the sample is taken.\\nCost of the procedure depends on the doctor, the\\nlab, and the tests ordered. Most insurers provide cov-\\nerage for women over 35, as a follow-up to positive\\nmaternal blood screening results, and when genetic\\ndisorders run in the family.\\nAn alternative to amnio, now in general use, is\\nchorionic villus sampling, or CVS, which can be per-\\nformed as early as the eighth week of pregnancy.\\nWhile this allows for the possibility of a first trimester\\nabortion, if warranted, CVS is apparently also riskier\\nand is more expensive. The most promising area of\\nnew research in prenatal testing involves expanding\\nthe scope and accuracy of maternal blood screening\\nas this poses no risk to the fetus.\\nPreparation\\nIt is important for a woman to fully understand\\nthe procedure and to feel confident in the obstetrician\\nperforming it. Evidence suggests that a physician’s\\nexperience with the procedure reduces the chance of\\nmishap. Almost all obstetricians are experienced in\\nperforming amniocentesis. The patient should feel\\nfree to ask questions and seek emotional support\\nbefore, during and after the amnio is performed.\\nAftercare\\nNecessary aftercare falls into two categories,\\nphysical and emotional.\\nPhysical aftercare\\nDuring and immediately following the sampling\\nprocedure, a woman may experience dizziness,nausea,\\na rapid heartbeat, and cramping. Once past these\\nimmediate hurdles, the physician will send the\\nwoman home with instructions to rest and to report\\nany complications requiring immediate treatment,\\nincluding:\\n/C15vaginal bleeding. The appearance of blood could\\nsignal a problem.\\n/C15premature labor. Unusual abdominal pain and/or\\ncramping may indicate the onset of premature labor.\\nMild cramping for the first day or two following the\\nprocedure is normal.\\n/C15signs of infection. Leaking of amniotic fluid or unu-\\nsual vaginal discharge, and fever could signal the\\nonset of infection.\\nEmotional aftercare\\nOnce the procedure has been safely completed, the\\nanxiety of waiting for the test results can prove to be\\nthe worst part of the process. A woman should seek\\nand receive emotional support from family and\\nfriends, as well as from her obstetrician and family\\ndoctor. Professional counseling may also prove neces-\\nsary, particularly if a fetal defect is discovered.\\nRisks\\nMost of the risks and short-term side effects asso-\\nciated with amniocentesis relate to the sampling pro-\\ncedure and have been discussed above. A successful\\namnio sampling results in no long-term side effects.\\nRisks include:\\n/C15maternal/fetal hemorrhaging.

Most amputations involve small body\\nparts such as a finger, rather than an entire limb.\\nAbout 65,000 amputations are performed in the\\nUnited States each year.\\nAmputation is performed for the following reasons:\\n/C15to remove tissue that no longer has an adequate\\nblood supply\\n/C15to remove malignant tumors\\n/C15because of severe trauma to the body part\\nThe blood supply to an extremity can be cut off\\nbecause of injury to the blood vessel, hardening of\\nthe arteries,arterial embolism, impaired circulation\\nas a complication ofdiabetes mellitus, repeated severe\\ninfection that leads to gangrene, severe frostbite,\\nRaynaud’s disease, or Buerger’s disease.\\nMore than 90% of amputations performed in the\\nUnited States are due to circulatory complications of\\ndiabetes.

The stump is moved often to\\nencourage good circulation. Physical therapy and\\nrehabilitation are startedas soon as possible, usually\\nwithin 48 hours. Studies have shown that there is a\\npositive relationship betwe en early rehabilitation\\nand effective functioning of the stump and prosthe-\\nsis. Length of stay in the hospital depends on the\\nseverity of the amputation and the general health\\nof the amputee, but ranges from several days to\\ntwo weeks.\\nRehabilitation is a long, arduous process, espe-\\ncially for above the knee amputees. Twice daily physical\\ntherapy is not uncommon. In addition, psychological\\ncounseling is an important part of rehabilitation.\\nMany people feel a sense of loss and grief when they\\nlose a body part. Others are bothered by phantom\\nlimb syndrome, where they feel as if the amputated\\npart is still in place. They may even feel pain in the limb\\nthat does not exist. Many amputees benefit from join-\\ning self-help groups and meeting others who are also\\nliving with amputation. Addressing the emotional\\naspects of amputation often speeds the physical reha-\\nbilitation process.\\nRisks\\nAmputation is major surgery. All the risks asso-\\nciated with the administration of anesthesia exist,\\nalong with the possibility of heavy blood loss and\\nthe development ofblood clots. Infection is of spe-\\ncial concern to amputees. Infection rates in amputa-\\ntions average 15%. If the stump becomes infected, it\\nis necessary to remove the prosthesis and sometimes\\nto amputate a second time at a higher level.\\nFailure of the stump to heal is another major\\ncomplication. Nonhealing is usually due to an inade-\\nquate blood supply. The rate of nonhealing varies\\nfrom 5-30% depending on the facility. Centers that\\nspecialize in amputation usually have the lowest rates\\nof complication.\\nPersistent pain in the stump or pain in the phan-\\ntom limb is experienced by most amputees to some\\ndegree. Treatment of phantom limb pain is difficult.\\nFinally, many amputees give up on the rehabilitation\\nprocess and discard their prosthesis. Better fitting\\nprosthetics and earlier rehabilitation have decreased\\nthe incidence of this problem.

Odle\\nAmylase tests\\nDefinition\\nAmylase is a digestive enzyme made primarily by\\nthe pancreas and salivary glands. Enzymes are sub-\\nstances made and used by the body to trigger specific\\nchemical reactions. The primary function of the\\nenzyme amylase is to break down starches in food so\\nthat they can be used by the body. Amylase testing\\nis usually done to determine the cause of sudden\\nabdominal pain.\\nPurpose\\nAmylase testing is performed to diagnose a num-\\nber of diseases that elevate amylase levels. Pancreatitis,\\nfor example, is the most common reason for a high\\namylase level. When the pancreas is inflamed, amylase\\nescapes from the pancreas into the blood. Within six to\\n48 hours after thepain begins, amylase levels in the\\nblood start to rise. Levels will stay high for several days\\nbefore gradually returning to normal.\\nThere are other causes of increased amylase. An\\nulcer that erodes tissue from the stomach and goes\\ninto the pancreas will cause amylase to spill into the\\nblood. During amumps infection, amylase from the\\ninflamed salivary glands increases. Amylase is also\\nfound in the liver, fallopian tubes, and small intestine;\\ninflammation of these tissues also increases levels. Gall\\nbladder disease, tumors of the lung or ovaries, alcohol\\npoisoning, ruptured aortic aneurysm, and intestinal\\nstrangulation or perforation can also cause unusually\\nhigh amylase levels.\\nPrecautions\\nThis is not a screening test for future pancreatic\\ndisease.\\nDescription\\nAmylase testing is done on both blood and\\nurine. The laboratory may use any of several testing\\nmethods that involve mixing the blood or urine sam-\\nple with a substance with which amylase is known to\\nreact. By measuring the end-product or the reaction\\ntime, technicians can calculate the amount of amy-\\nlase present in the sample. More sophisticated meth-\\nods separately measure the amylase made by the\\npancreas and the amylase made by the salivary\\nglands.\\nUrine testing is a better long-term monitor of\\namylase levels. The kidneys quickly move extra\\namylase from the blood into the urine. Urine levels\\nrise six to 10 hours after blood levels and stay high\\nlonger. Urine is usually collected throughout a 2- or\\n24-hour time period. Results are usually available the\\nsame day.\\nPreparation\\nIn most cases, no special preparation is necessary\\nfor a person undergoing an amylase blood test.\\nPatients taking longer term urine amylase tests will\\nbe given a container and instructions for collecting\\nthe urine at home. The urine should be refrigerated\\nuntil it is brought to the laboratory.\\nAftercare\\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\\nsite or the person may feel dizzy or faint.

Amyloidosis, which occurs\\nwhen accumulated amyloid deposits impair normal\\nbody function, can cause organ failure ordeath.I t\\nis a rare disease, occurring in about eight of every\\n1,000,000 people. It affects males and females equally\\nand usually develops after the age of 40. At least 15\\ntypes of amyloidosis have been identified. Each one\\nis associated with deposits of a different kind of\\nprotein.\\nTypes of amyloidosis\\nThe major forms of this disease are primary sys-\\ntemic, secondary, and familial or hereditary amyloi-\\ndosis. There is also another form of amyloidosis\\nassociated withAlzheimer’s disease.\\nPrimary systemic amyloidosis usually develops\\nbetween the ages of 50 and 60. With about 2,000 new\\ncases diagnosed annually, primary systemic amyloido-\\nsis is the most common form of this disease in the\\nUnited States. Also known as light-chain-related amy-\\nloidosis, it may also occur in association withmultiple\\nmyeloma (bone marrowcancer).\\nSecondary amyloidosis is a result of chronic infec-\\ntion or inflammatory disease. It is often associated\\nwith:\\n/C15familial Mediterranean fever (a bacterial infection\\ncharacterized by chills, weakness, headache, and\\nrecurring fever)\\n/C15granulomatous ileitis (inflammation of the small\\nintestine)\\n/C15Hodgkin’s disease (cancer of the lymphatic system)\\n/C15leprosy\\n/C15osteomyelitits (bacterial infection of bone and bone\\nmarrow)\\n/C15rheumatoid arthritis\\nFamilial or hereditary amyloidosis is the only\\ninherited form of the disease. It occurs in members of\\nmost ethnic groups, and each family has a distinctive\\npatternofsymptoms andorganinvolvement. Hereditary\\namyloidosis is though to be autosomal dominant,\\nwhich means that only one copy of the defective gene\\nis necessary to cause the disease. A child of a parent\\nwith familial amyloidosis has a 50-50 chance of devel-\\noping the disease.\\nAmyloidosis can involve any organ or system in\\nthe body.

Most\\npatients have gastrointestinal abnormalities, but\\nother symptoms vary according to the organ(s) or\\nsystem(s) affected by the disease. Usually the affected\\norgans are rubbery, firm, and enlarged.\\nHeart\\nBecause amyloid protein deposits can limit the\\nheart’s ability to fill with blood between beats, even\\nthe slightest exertion can causeshortness of breath.I f\\nthe heart’s electrical system is affected, the heart’s\\nrhythm may become erratic. The heart may also be\\nenlarged andheart murmurs may be present.\\nCongestive heart failure may result.\\nKidneys\\nThe feet, ankles, and calves swell when amyloidosis\\ndamages the kidneys. The kidneys become small and\\nhard, and kidney failure may result. It is not unusual for\\na patient to lose 20-25 pounds and develop a distaste for\\nmeat, eggs, and other protein-rich foods. Cholesterol\\nelevations that don’t respond to medication and protein\\nin the urine (proteinuria) are common.\\nNervous system\\nNervous system symptoms often appear in\\npatients with familial amyloidosis. Inflammation and\\ndegeneration of the peripheral nerves (peripheral neu-\\nropathy) may be present. One of four patients with\\namyloidosis has carpal tunnel syndrome, a painful\\ndisorder that causesnumbness or tingling in response\\nto pressure on nerves around the wrist. Amyloidosis\\nthat affects nerves to the feet can cause burning or\\nnumbness in the toes and soles and eventually weaken\\nthe legs. If nerves controlling bowel function are\\ninvolved, bouts ofdiarrhea alternate with periods of\\nconstipation. If the disease affects nerves that regulate\\nblood pressure, patients may feel dizzy or faint when\\nthey stand up suddenly.\\nLiver and spleen\\nThe most common symptoms are enlargement of\\nthese organs. Liver function is not usually affected\\nuntil quite late in the course of the disease. Protein\\naccumulation in the spleen can increase the risk of\\nrupture of this organ due to trauma.\\nGastrointestinal system\\nThe tongue may be inflammed, enlarged, and stiff.\\nIntestinal movement (motility) may be reduced.\\nAbsorption of food and other nutrients may be\\nimpaired (and may lead tomalnutrition), and there\\nmay also be bleeding, abdominalpain, constipation,\\nand diarrhea.\\nSkin\\nSkin symptoms occur in about half of all cases\\nof primary and secondary amyloidosis and in all\\ncases where there is inflammation or degeneration of\\nthe peripheral nerves.

It is also\\nknown as motor neuron disease and Lou Gehrig’s\\ndisease, after the baseball player whose career it ended.\\nDescription\\nALS is a disease of the motor neurons, those nerve\\ncells reaching from the brain to the spinal cord (upper\\nmotor neurons) and the spinal cord to the peripheral\\nnerves (lower motor neurons) that control muscle\\nmovement. In ALS, for unknown reasons, these\\nneurons die, leading to a progressive loss of the ability\\nto move virtually any of the muscles in the body. ALS\\naffects ‘‘voluntary’’ muscles, those controlled by con-\\nscious thought, such as the arm, leg, and trunk mus-\\ncles. ALS, in and of itself, does not affect sensation,\\nthought processes, the heart muscle, or the ‘‘smooth’’\\nmuscle of the digestive system, bladder, and other\\ninternal organs. Most people with ALS retain function\\nof their eye muscles as well. However, various forms\\nof ALS may be associated with a loss of intellectual\\nfunction (dementia) or sensory symptoms.\\nALS progresses rapidly in most cases. It is fatal\\nwithin three years for 50% of all people affected, and\\nwithin five years for 80%. Ten percent of people with\\nALS live beyond eight years.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe symptoms of ALS are caused by the death of\\nmotor neurons in the spinal cord and brain.

Further research may show\\nthat other pathways are involved, perhaps ones even\\nmore important than this one. Autoimmune factors or\\nprematureaging may play some role, as could viral\\nagents or environmental toxins.\\nTwo major forms of ALS are known: familial and\\nsporadic. Familial ALS accounts for about 10% of all\\nALS cases. As the name suggests, familial ALS is\\nbelieved to be caused by the inheritance of one or\\nmore faulty genes. About 15% of families with this\\ntype of ALS have mutations in the gene for SOD-1.\\nSOD-1 gene defects are dominant, meaning only one\\ngene copy is needed to develop the disease. Therefore,\\na parent with the faulty gene has a 50% chance of\\npassing the gene along to a child.\\nSporadic ALS has no known cause. While many\\nenvironmental toxins have been suggested as causes,\\nto date no research has confirmed any of the candi-\\ndates investigated, including aluminum and mercury\\nand lead from dental fillings. As research progresses, it\\nis likely that many cases of sporadic ALS will be\\nshown to have a genetic basis as well.\\nA third type, called Western Pacific ALS, occurs\\nin Guam and other Pacific islands. This form com-\\nbines symptoms of both ALS and Parkinson’s disease.\\nSymptoms\\nThe earliest sign of ALS is most often weakness in\\nthe arms or legs, usually more pronounced on one side\\nthan the other at first. Loss of function is usually more\\nrapid in the legs among people with familial ALS and\\nin the arms among those with sporadic ALS. Leg\\nweakness may first become apparent by an increased\\nfrequency of stumbling on uneven pavement, or an\\nunexplained difficulty climbing stairs. Arm weakness\\nmay lead to difficulty grasping and holding a cup, for\\ninstance, or loss of dexterity in the fingers.\\nLess often, the earliest sign of ALS is weakness in\\nthe bulbar muscles, those muscles in the mouth and\\nthroat that control chewing, swallowing, and speak-\\ning. A person with bulbar weakness may become\\nhoarse or tired after speaking at length, or speech\\nmay become slurred.\\nIn addition to weakness, the other cardinal signs\\nof ALS are muscle wasting and persistent twitching\\n(fasciculation). These are usually seen after weakness\\nbecomes obvious. Fasciculation is quite common in\\npeople without the disease, and is virtually never the\\nfirst sign of ALS.\\nWhile initial weakness may be limited to one\\nregion, ALS almost always progresses rapidly to\\ninvolve virtually all the voluntary muscle groups in\\nthe body. Later symptoms include loss of the ability\\nto walk, to use the arms and hands, to speak clearly or\\nat all, to swallow, and to hold the head up. Weakness\\nof the respiratory muscles makes breathing and\\ncoughing difficult, and poor swallowing control\\nincreases the likelihood of inhaling food or saliva\\n(aspiration).

An electrical test of muscle function,\\ncalled an electromyogram, or EMG, is an important\\npart of the diagnostic process. Various other tests,\\nincluding blood and urine tests, x rays, and CT\\nscans, may be done to rule out other possible causes\\nof the symptoms, such as tumors of the skull base or\\nhigh cervical spinal cord, thyroid disease, spinal\\narthritis, lead poisoning, or severe vitamin deficiency.\\nALS is rarely misdiagnosed following a careful review\\nof all these factors.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAspiration— Inhalation of food or liquids into the\\nlungs.\\nBulbar muscles— Muscles of the mouth and throat\\nresponsible for speech and swallowing.\\nFasciculations— Involuntary twitching of muscles.\\nMotor neuron— A nerve cell that controls a\\nmuscle.\\nRiluzole (Rilutek)— The first drug approved in the\\nUnited States for the treatment of ALS.\\nVoluntary muscle— A muscle under conscious\\ncontrol; contrasted with smooth muscle and heart\\nmuscle which are not under voluntary control.\\n172 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 202, 'page_label': '203'}, page_content='Treatment\\nThere is no cure for ALS, and no treatment that\\ncan significantly alter its course. There are many\\nthings which can be done, however, to help maintain\\nquality of life and to retain functional ability even in\\nthe face of progressive weakness.\\nAs of the early 2000s, only one drug had been\\napproved for treatment of ALS. Riluzole (Rilutek)\\nappears to provide on average a three-month increase\\nin life expectancy when taken regularly early in the\\ndisease, and shows a significant slowing of the loss of\\nmuscle strength. Riluzole acts by decreasing gluta-\\nmate release from nerve terminals. Experimental\\ntrials of nerve growth factor have not demonstrated\\nany benefit. No other drug or vitamin currently avail-\\nable has been shown to have any effect on the course\\nof ALS.\\nA physical therapist works with an affected\\nperson and family to implementexercise and stretch-\\ning programs to maintain strength and range of\\nmotion, and to promote general health. Swimming\\nmay be a good choice for people with ALS, as it\\nprovides a low-impact workout to most muscle\\ngroups. One result of chronic inactivity is contrac-\\nture, or muscle shortening.Contractures limit a per-\\nson’s range of motion, and are often painful. Regular\\nstretching can prevent contracture. Several drugs are\\navailable to reduce cramping, a common complaint\\nin ALS.\\nAn occupational therapist can help design solu-\\ntions to movement and coordination problems, and\\nprovide advice on adaptive devices and home\\nmodifications.\\nSpeech and swallowing difficulties can be mini-\\nmized or delayed through training provided by a\\nspeech-language pathologist. This specialist can also\\nprovide advice on communication aids, including\\ncomputer-assisted devices and simpler word boards.\\nNutritional advice can be provided by a nutrition-\\nist. A person with ALS often needs softer foods to\\nprevent jaw exhaustion orchoking. Later in the\\ndisease, nutrition may be provided by agastrostomy\\ntube inserted into the stomach.\\nMechanical ventilation may be used when breath-\\ning becomes too difficult. Modern mechanical venti-\\nlators are small and portable, allowing a person with\\nALS to maintain the maximum level of function and\\nmobility. Ventilation may be administered through a\\nmouth or nose piece, or through a tracheostomy tube.\\nThis tube is inserted through a small hole made in the\\nwindpipe. In addition to providing direct access to the\\nairway, the tube also decreases the risk aspiration.\\nWhile many people with rapidly progressing ALS\\nchoose not to use ventilators for lengthy periods,\\nthey are increasingly being used to prolong life for a\\nshort time.\\nThe progressive nature of ALS means that most\\npersons will eventually require full-time nursing care.\\nThis care is often provided by a spouse or other family\\nmember. While the skills involved are not difficult\\nto learn, the physical and emotional burden of care\\ncan be overwhelming. Caregivers need to recognize\\nand provide for their own needs as well as those of\\npeople with ALS, to prevent depression, burnout, and\\nbitterness.\\nThroughout the disease, a support group can pro-\\nvide important psychological aid to affected persons\\nand their caregivers as they come to terms with the\\nlosses ALS inflicts. Support groups are sponsored by\\nboth the ALS Society and the Muscular Dystrophy\\nAssociation.\\nAlternative treatment\\nGiven the grave prognosis and absence of tradi-\\ntional medical treatments, it is not surprising that a\\nlarge number of alternative treatments have been\\ntried for ALS. Two studies published in 1988 sug-\\ngested that amino-acid therapies may provide some\\nimprovement for some people with ALS. While indi-\\nvidual reports claim benefits for megavitamin the-\\nrapy, herbal medicine, and removal of dental fillings,\\nfor instance, no evidence suggests that these offer\\nany more than a brief psychological boost, often\\nfollowed by a more severe letdown when it becomes\\napparent the disease has continued unabated.\\nHowever, once the causes of ALS are better under-\\nstood, alternative therapies may be more intensively\\nstudied. For example, if damage by free radicals\\nturns out to be the root of most of the symptoms,\\nantioxidant vitamins and supplements may be used\\nmore routinely to slow theprogression of ALS. Or, if\\nenvironmental toxins are implicated, alternative\\ntherapies with the goal of detoxifying the body may\\nbe of some use.\\nPrognosis\\nALS usually progresses rapidly, and leads to\\ndeath from respiratory infection within three to five\\nyears in most cases. The slowest disease progression is\\nseen in those who are young and have their first symp-\\ntoms in the limbs.

Fleming Fallon, Jr., MD, DrPH\\nAnabolic steroid use\\nDefinition\\nAnabolic steroids are drugs containing hormones,\\nor hormone-like substances, that are used to increase\\nstrength and promote muscle growth.\\nDescription\\nSteroids are a synthetic version of the human\\nhormone called testosterone. Testosterone stimulates\\nand maintains the male sexual organs. It also stimu-\\nlates development of bones and muscle, promotes\\nskin and hair growth, and can influence emotions\\nand energy levels. In males, testosterone is produced\\nby the testicles and the adrenal gland. Women have\\nonly the amount of testosterone produced by the\\nadrenal gland—much less than men have. This is\\nwhy testosterone is often called a ‘‘male’’ hormone.\\nThere are more than 100 different types of anabolic\\nsteroids that have been developed, and each requires\\nap r e s c r i p t i o nt ob eu s e dl e g a l l yi nt h eU n i t e dS t a t e s .\\nThe average adult male naturally produces 2.5 to 11\\nmilligrams of testosterone daily. The average steroid\\nabuser often takes more than 100 mg a day, through\\n‘‘stacking’’ or combining several different brands of\\nsteroids.\\nMedical uses\\nAnabolic steroids were first developed in the\\n1930s in Europe, in part to increase the physical\\nstrength of German soldiers. Anabolic steroids were\\ntried by physicians for many other purposes in the\\n1940s and 1950s with varying success. Disadvantages\\noutweighed benefits for most purposes, and during the\\nlater decades of the twentieth century medical use in\\nNorth America and Europe was restricted to a few\\nconditions. These include:\\n/C15Bone marrow stimulation: During the second half of\\nthe twentieth century anabolic steroids were the\\nmainstay of therapy for hypoplastic anemia not due\\nto nutrient deficiency, especially aplastic anemia.\\nAnabolic steroids were slowly replaced by synthetic\\nprotein hormones that selectively stimulate growth\\nof blood cell precursors.\\n/C15Growth stimulation: Anabolic steroids were used\\nheavily by pediatric endocrinologists for children\\nwith growth failure from the 1960s through the\\n1980s. Availability of synthetic growth hormone\\nand increasing social stigmatization of anabolic ste-\\nroids led to reduction of this use.\\n174 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAnabolic steroid use'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 204, 'page_label': '205'}, page_content='/C15Stimulation of appetite and preservation of muscle\\nmass: Anabolic steroids have been given to people\\nwith chronic wasting conditions such ascancer and\\nHIV/AIDS.\\n/C15Induction of malepuberty: Androgens are given to\\nmany boys distressed about extreme delay of pub-\\nerty.

Many of the male athletes developed such large\\nprostate glands (a gland located near the bladder and\\nurethra that aids in semen production) that they\\nneeded a tube inserted in order to urinate. Some of\\nthe female athletes developed so many male character-\\nistics chromosome tests were necessary to prove that\\nthey were still women. Competitive weightlifters also\\nbegan using steroids in the 1950s as a way to increase\\ntheir athletic performance. Use gradually spread\\nthroughout the world among athletes in other sports.\\nConcerns over the growing illicit market and the\\nprevalence of abuse, combined with the possibility of\\nharmful long-term effects of steroids use, led the U.S.\\nCongress in 1991 to place anabolic steroids in\\nSchedule III of the Controlled Substances Act\\n(CSA). The CSA defines anabolic steroids as any\\ndrug or hormonal substance chemically and pharma-\\ncologically related to testosterone (other than estro-\\ngens, progestins, andcorticosteroids) that promotes\\nmuscle growth. Most illicit anabolic steroids are sold\\nat gyms, bodybuilding competitions, and through the\\nmail and Internet. For the most part, these substances\\nare smuggled into the United States. Anabolic steroids\\ncommonly encountered on the illicit market include:\\nboldenone (Equipoise), ethlestrenol (Maxibolin),\\nfluoxymesterone (Halotestin), methandriol, methan-\\ndrostenolone (Dianabol), methyltestosterone, nan-\\ndrolone (Durabolin, DecaDurabolin), oxandrolone\\n(Anavar), oxymetholone (Anadrol), stanozolol\\n(Winstrol), testosterone (including sustanon), and\\ntrenbolone (Finajet).

Androstenedione acts like\\na steroid once it is metabolized by the body and can\\npose similar kinds of health risks.

In response, Congress held hearings in\\nMarch 2005 on steroid abuse in the MLB, subpoenaing\\nsuch baseball superstars as home run champion Mark\\nMcGwire (now retired), Sammy Sosa, and Curt\\nSchilling to testify. In response, MLB officials promised\\na crackdown on anabolic steroid use among players.\\nIt has been estimated that at least one in 15 male\\nhigh school seniors in the United States—more than\\n500,000 boys—has used steroids. Some are athletes\\nattempting to increase their strength and size; others\\nare simply youths attempting to speed up their growth\\nto keep pace with their peers. In some countries, ana-\\nbolic steroids are available over the counter. In the\\nUnited States, a doctor’s prescription is necessary.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhile the effects of steroids can seem desirable at\\nfirst, there are serious side effects. Excessive use can\\ncause a harmful imbalance in the body’s normal hor-\\nmonal balance and body chemistry. Heart attacks,\\nwater retention leading to high blood pressure and\\nstroke, and liver and kidney tumors all are possible.\\nYoung people may developacne, sometimes severe,\\nand a halting of bone growth. Males may experience\\nshrinking testicles, falling sperm counts, enlarged\\nbreasts, and enlarged prostate glands. Women fre-\\nquently show signs of masculinity and may be at higher\\nrisk for certain types of cancer and the possibility of\\nbirth defectsin their children. Steroids fool the body\\ninto thinking that testosterone is being produced. The\\nbody, sensing an excess of testosterone, shuts down\\nbodily functions involving testosterone, such as bone\\ngrowth. The ends of long bones fuse together and stop\\ngrowing, resulting in stunted growth.\\nThe psychological effects of steroid use are also\\nalarming: drastic mood swings, inability to sleep,\\ndepression, and feelings of hostility. Steroids may\\nalso be psychologically addictive. Once started,\\nusers—particularly athletes—enjoy the physical so-\\ncalled benefits of increased size, strength, and endur-\\nance so much that they are reluctant to stop even when\\ntold about the risks.\\nIn addition to these dangerous side effects, steroid\\nabuse brings other risks, some of which are connected\\nto the way some steroids are manufactured and dis-\\ntributed. The drugs are often made in motel rooms and\\nwarehouses in Mexico, Europe, and other countries\\nand then smuggled into the United States. The\\npotency, purity, and strength of the steroids produced\\nthis way are not regulated; therefore, users cannot\\nknow how much they are taking.

Wells\\nAnaerobic infections\\nDefinition\\nAn anaerobic infection is an infection caused by\\nbacteria (called anaerobes) which cannot grow in the\\npresence of oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria can infect\\ndeep wounds, deep tissues, and internal organs where\\nthere is little oxygen. These infections are character-\\nized byabscess formation, foul-smelling pus, and tis-\\nsue destruction.\\nDescription\\nAnaerobic means ‘‘life without air.’’ Anaerobic\\nbacteria grow in places which completely, or almost\\ncompletely, lack oxygen. They are normally found in\\nthe mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina, and on\\nthe skin. Commonly known diseases caused by anae-\\nrobic bacteria include gasgangrene, tetanus,a n dbotu-\\nlism. Nearly all dental infections are caused by\\nanaerobic bacteria.\\nAnaerobic bacteria can cause an infection when a\\nnormal barrier (such as skin, gums, or intestinal wall)\\nis damaged due to surgery, injury, or disease. Usually,\\nthe immune system kills any invading bacteria, but\\nsometimes the bacteria are able to grow and cause an\\ninfection. Body sites that have tissue destruction\\n(necrosis) or a poor blood supply are low in oxygen\\nand favor the growth of anaerobic bacteria. The low\\noxygen condition can result from blood vessel disease,\\nshock, injury, and surgery.\\nAnaerobic bacteria can cause infection practically\\nanywhere in the body. For example:\\n/C15Mouth, head, and neck. Infections can occur in the\\nroot canals, gums (gingivitis), jaw, tonsils, throat,\\nsinuses, and ears.\\n/C15Lung. Anaerobic bacteria can causepneumonia,l u n g\\nabscesses, infecton of the lining of the lung\\n(empyema), and dilated lung bronchi (bronchiectasis).\\n/C15Intraabdominal. Anaerobic infections within the\\nabdomen include abscess formation,peritonitis, and\\nappendicitis.\\n/C15Female genital tract. Anaerobic bacteria can cause\\npelvic abscesses,pelvic inflammatory disease, inflam-\\nmation of the uterine lining (endometritis), and pelvic\\ninfections following abortion,childbirth, and surgery.\\n/C15Skin and soft tissue. Anaerobic bacteria are common\\ncauses of diabetic skin ulcers, gangrene, destructive\\ninfection of the deep skin and tissues (necrotizing\\nfascitis), and bite wound infections.\\n/C15Central nervous system. Anaerobic bacteria can\\ncause brain and spinal cord abscesses.\\n/C15Bloodstream. Anaerobic bacteria can be found in the\\nbloodstream of ill patients (a condition called\\nbacteremia).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPeople who have experienced shock, injury, or\\nsurgery, and those with blood vessel disease or\\ntumors are at an increased risk for infection by anae-\\nrobic bacteria. There are many different kinds of\\nanaerobic bacteria which can cause an infection.\\nIndeed, most anaerobic infections are ‘‘mixed infec-\\ntions’’ which means that there is a mixture of differ-\\nent bacteria growing. The anaerobic bacteria that\\nKEY TERMS\\nAbscess— A lump filled with pus resulting from an\\ninfection.\\nAnaerobic— Living and growing in the absence of\\noxygen.\\nNecrosis— Tissue death and destruction resulting\\nfrom infection or disease.\\n178 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAnaerobic infections'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 208, 'page_label': '209'}, page_content='most frequently ca use infections are Bacteroides\\nfragilis, Peptostreptococcus ,a n dClostridium species.\\nThe signs and symptoms of anaerobic infection can\\nvary depending on the location of the infection. In gen-\\neral, anaerobic infections result in tissue destruction, an\\nabscess which drains foul-smelling pus, and possibly\\nfever. Symptoms for specific infections are as follows:\\n/C15Tooth and gum infections. Swollen, tender bleeding\\ngums, bad breath,a n dpain. Severe infections may\\nproduce oozing sores.\\n/C15Throat infection. An extremely sore throat, bad\\nbreath, a bad taste in the mouth, fever, and a sense\\nofchoking.\\n/C15Lung infection.

Foul-smelling pus or blood draining\\nfrom the uterus, general or localized pelvic pain,\\nfever, and chills.\\n/C15Skin and soft tissue infection. Infected wounds are\\nred, painful, swollen, and may drain a foul-smelling\\npus. Skin infection causes localized swelling, pain,\\nredness, and possibly a painful, open sore (ulcer)\\nwhich drains foul-smelling pus. Severe skin infections\\nmay cause extensive tissue destruction (necrosis).\\n/C15Bloodstream. Bloodstream invasion causes high\\nfever (up to 1058F [40.68C]), chills, a general ill feel-\\ning, and is potentially fatal.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of anaerobic infection is based pri-\\nmarily on symptoms, the patient’s medical history,\\nand location of the infection. A foul-smelling infection\\nor drainage from an abscess is diagnostic of anaerobic\\ninfection. This foul smell is produced by anaerobic\\nbacteria and occurs in one third to one half of patients\\nlate in the infection. Other clues to anaerobic infection\\ninclude tissue necrosis and gas production at the infection\\nsite. A sample from the infected site may be obtained,\\nu s i n gas w a bo ran e e d l ea n ds y r i n g e ,t od e t e r m i n ew h i c h\\nbacteria is (are) causing the infection. Because these bac-\\nteria can be easily killed by oxygen, they rarely grow in\\nthe laboratory cultures of tissue or pus samples.\\nThe recent medical history of the patient is helpful\\nin diagnosing anaerobic infection. A patient who has or\\nrecently had surgery, dental work, tumors, blood vessel\\ndisease, or injury are susceptible to this infection. The\\nfailure to improve following treatment withantibiotics\\nthat aren’t able to kill anaerobes is another clue that\\nthe infection is caused by anaerobes. The location and\\ntype of infection also help in the diagnosis.\\nDiagnostic tests may include blood tests to see if\\nbacteria are in the bloodstream and x rays to look at\\ninternal infections.\\nTreatment\\nSerious infections may require hospitalization for\\ntreatment. Immediate antibiotic treatment of anaerobic\\ninfections is necessary. Laboratory testing may identify\\nthe bacteria causing the infection and also which anti-\\nbiotic will work best. Every antibiotic does not work\\nagainst all anaerobic bacteria but nearly all anaerobes\\nare killed by chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin), metro-\\nnidazole (Flagyl or Protostat), and imipenem\\n(Primaxin). Other antibiotics which may be used are\\nclindamycin (Cleocin) or cefoxitin (Mefoxin).\\nSurgical removal or drainage of the abscess is\\nalmost always required. This may involve drainage\\nby needle and syringe to remove the pus from a skin\\nabscess (called ‘‘aspiration’’). The area would be\\nnumbed prior to the aspiration procedure. Also,\\nsome internal abscesses can be drained using this\\nprocedure with the help of ultrasound (a device\\nwhich uses sound waves to visualize internal organs).\\nThis type of abscess drainage may be performed in\\nthe doctor’s office.\\nPrognosis\\nComplete recovery should be achieved with the\\nappropriate surgery and antibiotic treatment.\\nUntreated or uncontrolled infections can cause severe\\ntissue and bone destruction, which would requireplas-\\ntic surgery to repair. Serious infections can be life\\nthreatening.\\nPrevention\\nAlthough anaerobic infections can occur in any-\\none, good hygiene and general health may help to\\nprevent infections.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFauci, Anthony S., et al., editors.Harrison’s Principles of\\nInternal Medicine.

In\\nboys with high anal atresia, there may be a channel\\n(fistula) connecting the large intestine to either the\\nurethra (which delivers urine from the bladder) or\\nthe bladder itself. In girls, the channel may connect\\nwith the vagina. Sixty percent of children with high\\nanal atresia have other defects, including problems\\nwith the esophagus, urinary tract, and bones. In low\\nanal atresia, the channel may open in front of the\\ncircular mass of muscles that constrict to close the\\nanal opening (anal sphincter) or, in boys, below\\nthe scrotum. Occasionally, the intestine ends just\\nunder the skin. It is estimated that overall abnormal-\\nities of the anus and rectum occur in about one in every\\n5,000 births and are slightly more common among\\nboys. A mother who has one child with these kind of\\nconditions has a 1% chance of having another child\\nwho suffers from this ailment.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnal atresia is a defect in the development of the\\nfetus. The cause is unknown, but genetics seem to play\\na minor role.\\nDiagnosis\\nUsually a physician can make an obvious visual\\ndiagnosis of anal atesia right after birth. Occasionally,\\nhowever, anal atresia is missed until the baby is fed and\\nsigns of intestinal obstruction appear. At the end of the\\nfirst or second day, the abdomen swells and there is\\nvomiting of fecal material. To determine the type of\\nanal atresia and the exact position, x rays will be taken\\nwhich include injecting opaque dye into the opening.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) orcomputed tomo-\\ngraphy scans(CT), as well as ultrasound, are the ima-\\nging techniques used to determine the type and size of\\nthe anal atresia. Ultrasound uses sound waves, CT\\nscans pass x rays through the body at different angles,\\nand an MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves.\\nTreatment\\nSurgery is the only treatment for anal atresia. For\\nhigh anal atresia, immediately after the diagnosis is\\nmade, a surgical incision is made in the large intestine\\nto make a temporary opening (colostomy) in the abdo-\\nmen where waste is excreted. Several months later, the\\nintestine is moved into the ring of muscle (sphincter)\\nthat is part of the anus and a hole is made in the skin.\\nThecolostomy is closed several weeks later. In low anal\\natresia, immediately after diagnosis, a hole is made in\\nthe skin to open the area where the anus should be. If\\nthe channel is in the wrong place, the intestine is\\nmoved into the correct position sometime during the\\nchild’s first year. After surgery, the pediatric surgeon\\nuses an instrument to dilate or widen the rectum and\\nteaches the parents how to do this daily at home to\\nprevent scar tissue from contracting.\\nPrognosis\\nWith high anal atresia, many children have pro-\\nblems controlling bowel function. Most also become\\nconstipated. With low anal atresia, children generally\\nhave good bowel control, but they may still become\\nconstipated.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no known way to prevent anal atresia.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nPaidas, Charles N., and Alberto Pena. ‘‘Rectum and Anus.’’\\nIn Surgery of Infants and Children.

The anus is the inch-and-a-half-\\nlong end portion of the large intestine, which opens\\nto allow solid wastes to exit the body. Other parts of\\nthe large intestine include the colon and the rectum.\\nDescription\\nDifferent cancers can develop in different parts of\\nthe anus, part of which is inside the body and part of\\nwhich is outside. Sometimes abnormal changes of the\\nanus are harmless in their early stages but may later\\ndevelop into cancer. Someanal warts, for example,\\ncontain precancerous areas and can develop into can-\\ncer. Types of anal cancer include:\\n/C15Squamous Cell Carcinomas. Approximately half of\\nanal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, which\\narise from the cells lining the anal margin and the\\nanal canal. The anal margin is the part of the anus\\nthat is half inside and half outside the body, and the\\nanal canal is the part of the anus that is inside the\\nbody. The earliest form of squamous cell carcinoma\\nis known as carcinoma in situ, or Bowen’s disease.\\n/C15Cloacogenic Carcinomas. Approximately one-\\nfourth to one-third of anal tumors are cloacogenic\\ncarcinomas. These tumors develop in the transitional\\nzone, or cloaca, which is a ring of tissue between the\\nanal canal and the rectum.\\n/C15Adenocarcinomas. About 15% of anal cancers are\\nadenocarcinomas, which affect glands in the anal\\narea. One type of adenocarcinoma that can occur in\\nthe anal area is called Paget’s disease, which can also\\naffect the vulva, breasts, and other areas of the body.\\n/C15Skin cancers. A small percentage of anal cancers are\\neither basal cell carcinomas, or malignant melano-\\nmas, two types of skin cancer. Malignant melano-\\nmas, which develop from skin cells that produce the\\nbrown pigment called melanin, are far more common\\non areas of the body exposed to the sun.\\nApproximately 3,500 Americans will be diag-\\nnosed with anal cancer in 2001, and an estimated 500\\nindividuals will die of the disease during this same\\ninterval, according to the American Cancer Society.\\nAnal cancers are fairly rare: they make up only 1% to\\n2% of cancers affecting the digestive system. The dis-\\nease affects women somewhat more often than men,\\nalthough the number of cases among men, particularly\\nhomosexual men, seems to be increasing.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of most anal cancers is unknown,\\nalthough certain individuals appear to have a higher\\nrisk of developing the disease. Smokers are at higher\\nrisk, as are individuals with certain types of the human\\npapillomavirus (HPV), and those with long-term pro-\\nblems in the anal area, such as abnormal openings\\nknown as fistulas. Since it increases the risk of HPV\\ninfection, the practice of anal sex appears to increase\\nthe risk of anal cancer—male homosexuals who prac-\\ntice anal sex are about 33 times more likely to have\\nanal cancers than heterosexual men. Those with wea-\\nkened immune systems, such individuals with HIV, or\\ntransplant patients taking immunosuppressant drugs,\\nare also at higher risk. Most individuals with anal\\ncancer are over the age of 50.\\nSymptoms of anal cancer resemble those found in\\nother harmless conditions. They include pain,itching\\nand bleeding, straining during a bowel movement,\\nchange in bowel habits, change in the diameter of the\\nstool, discharge from the anus, and swollen lymph\\nnodes in the anal or groin area.\\nDiagnosis\\nAnal cancer is sometimes diagnosed during rou-\\ntine physicals, or during minor procedures such as\\nKEY TERMS\\nBiopsy— A procedure in which a small piece of\\nbody tissue is removed and examined under a\\nmicroscope for cancer.\\nChemotherapy— A cancer treatment in which drugs\\ndelivered into the blood stream kill cancer cells or\\nmake them more vulnerable to radiation therapy.\\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV)— A virus with many\\nsubtypes, some of which cause cell changes that\\nincrease the risk of certain cancers.\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)— The virus\\nthat causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome\\n(AIDS).\\nLymph nodes— Bean-shaped structures found\\nthroughout the body that produce and store\\ninfection-fighting cells.\\nRadiation therapy— A cancer treatment that uses\\nhigh-energy rays to kill or weaken cancer cells.\\nRadiation may be delivered externally or internally\\nvia surgically implanted pellets.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 181\\nAnal cancer'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 211, 'page_label': '212'}, page_content='hemorrhoid removal. It may also be diagnosed during\\na digital rectal examination (DRE), when a physician\\ninserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the anus to\\nfeel for unusual growths. Individuals over the age of\\n50 who have no symptoms should have a digitalrectal\\nexamination (DRE) every five to 10 years, according\\nto American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines for early\\ndetection of colorectal cancer.\\nOther diagnostic procedures for anal cancer\\ninclude: Anoscopy. A procedure that involves use of a\\nspecial device to examine the anus. Proctoscopy. A\\nprocedure that involves use of a lighted scope to see\\nthe anal canal. Transrectal ultrasound. A procedure in\\nwhich sound waves are used to create an image of the\\nanus and nearby tissues.\\nA biopsy is performed on any suspicious growths;\\nthat is, a tiny piece of the growth is examined under a\\nmicroscope for cancer cells. The physician may also\\nperform a procedure called a fine needle aspiration\\nbiopsy, in which a needle is used to withdraw fluid\\nfrom lymph nodes located near the growth, to make\\nsure the cancer has not spread to these nodes.\\nAnal cancer severity is categorized by the follow-\\ning stages:\\n/C15Stage 0 anal cancer is found only in the top layer of\\nanal tissue.\\n/C15Stage I anal cancer has spread beyond the top layer\\nof anal tissue, but is less than 1 inch in diameter.\\n/C15Stage II anal cancer has spread beyond the top layer\\nof anal tissue and is larger than 1 inch in diameter,\\nbut has not spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes.\\n/C15Stage IIIA anal cancer has spread to the lymph nodes\\naround the rectum or to nearby organs such as the\\nvagina or bladder.\\n/C15Stage IIIB anal cancer has spread to lymph nodes in\\nthe mid-abdomen or groin, or to nearby organs and\\nthe lymph nodes around the rectum.\\n/C15Stage IV anal cancer has spread to distant lymph\\nnodes within the abdomen or to distantorgans.\\nTreatment\\nAnal cancer is treated using three methods, used\\neither in concert or individually: surgery, radiation\\ntherapy, andchemotherapy.\\nTwo types of surgery may be performed. A local\\nresection, performed if the cancer has not spread,\\nremoves the tumor and an area of tissue around\\nthe tumor. An abdominoperineal resection is a more\\ncomplex procedure in which the anus and the lower\\nrectum are removed, and an opening called acolost-\\nomy is created for body wastes to exit. This procedure\\nis fairly uncommon today because radiation and\\nchemotherapy are just as effective.\\nChemotherapy fights cancer using drugs, which\\nmay be delivered via pill or needle. Some chemother-\\napy types kill cancer cells directly, while others act\\nindirectly by making cancer cells more vulnerable to\\nradiation. The main drugs used to treat anal cancer\\nare 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin or 5-FU\\nand cisplatin. Side effects of chemotherapy, which\\ndamages normal cells in addition to cancer cells, may\\nincludenausea and vomiting, hair loss, loss of appetite,\\ndiarrhea, mouth sores, fatigue, shortness of breath,\\nand a weakened immune system.\\nAlternative treatment\\nResearch suggests acupuncture can help manage\\nchemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting and con-\\ntrol pain associated with surgery.\\nPrognosis\\nAnalcancer isoftencurable.Thechanceof recovery\\ndepends on the cancer stage and the patient’s general\\nhealth.\\nPrevention\\nReducing the risks of thesexually transmitted dis-\\neases HPV and HIV also reduces the risk of anal\\ncancer.

Most cases are caused by\\nsexual transmission.\\nMost individuals have between one to 10 genital\\nwarts thtat range in size from roughly 0.5–1.9 cm2.\\nSome will complain of painless bumps oritching, but\\noften, these warts can remain completely unnoticed.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCondyloma acuminatum is one of the most com-\\nmon sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United\\nStates. Young adults aged 17 to 33 years are at greatest\\nrisk. Risk factors include smoking, using oral contra-\\nceptives, having multiple sexual partners, and an early\\ncoital age. In addition, individuals who have a history of\\nimmunosuppression or anal intercourse are also at risk.\\nRoughly 90% of all anal warts are caused by the\\nhuman papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11, which\\nare the least likely of over 60 types of HPV to become\\ncancerous. Anal warts are usually transmitted through\\ndirect sexual contact with someone who is infected with\\ncondyloma acuminata anywhere in the genital area,\\nincluding the penis and vagina. Studies have shown\\nthat roughly 75% of those who engage in sexual con-\\ntact with someone infected with condyloma acuminata\\nwill develop these warts within three months.\\nTreatment\\nAccordingtoguidelinesfromtheCentersforDisease\\nControl (CDC), the treatment ofallgenital warts,includ-\\ning anal warts, should be conducted according to the\\nmethods preferred by the patient, the medications or\\nprocedures most readily available, and the experience\\nof the patient’s physician in removing anal warts.\\nTreatment options include electrical cautery, sur-\\ngical removal, or both. Warts that appear inside the\\nanal canal will almost always be treated with cauter-\\nization or surgical removal. Surgical removal, also\\nknown as excision, has the highest success rates and\\nlowest recurrence rates. Indeed, studies have shown\\nthat initial cure rates range from 63–91%.\\nUnfortunately, most cases require numerous\\ntreatments because the virus that causes the warts\\ncan live in the surrounding tissue. The area may seem\\nnormal and wart-free for six months or longer before\\nanother wart develops.\\nElectrocoagulation, a technique that uses electri-\\ncal energy to destroy the warts, is usually the most\\npainful of the procedures done to eliminate condy-\\nloma acuminata of the anus, and is usually reserved\\nfor larger warts. It is done withlocal anesthesia, and\\nmay cause discharge or bleeding from the anus.\\nFollow-up visits to the physician are necessary to\\nmake sure that the warts have not recurred. It is\\nrecommended that these patients see their physicians\\nevery three to six months for up to 1.5 years, which is\\nhow long the incubation period is for the HPV virus.\\nCarbon dioxide laser treatment and electrodesicca-\\ntion are other options, but these are usually reserved for\\nextensive warts or those that continue to recur despite\\nnumerous treatments. However, because HPV virus can\\nKEY TERMS\\nElectrocoagulation— at e c h n i q u eu s i n ge l e c t r i c a l\\nenergy to destroy the warts.

This agent\\noffers a cure rate of 20–50% when used alone, and is\\napplied by the physician weekly and then washed off\\n6 hours later by the patient.\\nPodofilox (Condylox) is another agent, and is\\navailable for patients to use at home. It can be applied\\ntwice daily for up to 4 weeks. Podofilox offers a\\nslightly higher cure rate than podophyllin, and can\\nalso be used to prevent warts.\\nTrichloroacetic and bichloroacetic acids are avail-\\nable in several concentrations up to 80% for the treat-\\nment of condyloma acuminata. These acids work to\\ncauterize the skin, and are quite caustic. Nevertheless,\\nthey cause less irritation and overall body effects than\\nthe other agents mentioned above. Recurrence, how-\\never, is higher with these acids.\\nBleomycin (Blenoxane) is another treatment\\noption, but it has several drawbacks. First, it must be\\nadministered by a physician into each lesion via injec-\\ntion, but is can have a host of side effects, and patients\\nmust be followed carefully by their physician.\\nImiquimod 5% cream is also available for patients\\nto apply themselves. It is to be applied three times\\nweekly, for up to 16 weeks, and has been shown to\\nclear warts within eight to 10 weeks.\\nFinally, the interferon drugs, which are naturally\\noccurring proteins that have antiviral and antitumor\\neffects, are available.

Other drugs, notably thetricyclic antidepres-\\nsants and anti-epileptic agents such as gabapentin, have\\nbeen used to relieve pain, particularly neurologic pain,\\nbut are not routinely classified as analgesics. Analgesics\\nprovide symptomatic relief, but have no effect on the\\ncause, although clearly the NSAIDs, by virtue of their\\ndual activity, may be beneficial in both regards.\\nDescription\\nPain has been classified as ‘‘productive’’ pain and\\n‘‘non-productive’’ pain. While this distinction has\\nno physiologic meaning, it may serve as a guide to\\ntreatment. ‘‘Productive’’ pain has been described as a\\nwarning of injury, and so may be both an indication of\\nneed for treatment and a guide to diagnosis. ‘‘Non-\\nproductive’’ pain by definition serves no purpose\\neither as a warning or diagnostic tool.\\nAlthough pain syndromes may be dissimilar, the\\ncommon factor is a sensory pathway from the affected\\norgan to the brain. Analgesics work at the level of the\\nnerves, either by blocking the signal from the periph-\\neral nervous system, or by distorting the interpretation\\nby the central nervous system. Selection of an appro-\\npriate analgesic is based on consideration of the risk-\\nbenefit factors of each class of drugs, based on type of\\npain, severity of pain, and risk of adverse effects.\\nTraditionally, pain has been divided into two classes,\\nacute and chronic, although severity and projected\\npatient survival are other factors that must be consid-\\nered in drug selection.\\nAcute pain\\nAcute pain is self limiting in duration, and\\nincludes post-operative pain, pain of injury, andchild-\\nbirth. Because pain of these types is expected to be\\nshort term, the long-term side effects of analgesic ther-\\napy may routinely be ignored. Thus, these patients\\nmay safely be treated with narcotic analgesics without\\nconcern about possibleaddiction, or NSAIDs with\\nonly limited concern for the risk of ulcers. Drugs and\\ndoses should be adjusted based on observation of\\nhealing rate, switching patients from high to low\\ndoses, and from narcotic analgesics to non-narcotics\\nwhen circumstances permit.\\nAn important consideration ofpain management\\nin severe pain is that patients should not be subject to\\nthe return of pain. Analgesics should be dosed\\nadequately to ensure that the pain is at least tolerable,\\nand frequently enough to avoid the anxiety that\\naccompanies the anticipated return of pain.\\nAnalgesics should never be dosed on an as needed\\nbasis, but should be administered often enough to\\nassure constant blood levels of analgesic. This applies\\nto both the narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics.\\nChronic pain\\nChronic pain, pain lasting over three months and\\nsevere enough to impair function, is more difficult to\\ntreat, since the anticipated side effects of the analgesics\\nare more difficult to manage. In the case of narcotic\\nanalgesics this means the addiction potential, as well\\nas respiratory depression andconstipation.F o rt h e\\nNSAIDs, the risk of gastric ulcers limit dose. While\\nsome classes of drugs, such as the narcotic agonist/\\nantagonist drugs bupronophine, nalbuphine and penta-\\nzocine, and the selectiveCOX-2 inhibitorscelecoxib and\\nrofecoxib represent advances in reduction of adverse\\neffects, they are still not fully suitable for long-term\\nmanagement of severe pain. Generally, chronic pain\\nmanagement requires a combination of drug therapy,\\nlife-style modification, and other treatment modalities.\\nNarcotic analgesics\\nThe narcotic analgesics, also termed opioids, are\\nall derived from opium. The class includes morphine,\\ncodeine, and a number of semi-synthetics including\\nmeperidine (Demerol), propoxyphen (Darvon) and\\nothers. The narcotic analgesics vary in potency, but all\\nare effective in treatment of visceral pain when used\\nin adequate doses. Adverse effects are dose related.\\nBecause these drugs are all addictive, they are controlled\\nunder federal and state laws. A variety of dosage forms\\nare available, including oral solids, liquids, intravenous\\nand intrathecal injections, and transcutaneous patches.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAcute pain— Pain that is usually temporary and\\nresults from something specific, such as a surgery,\\nan injury, or an infection.\\nAnalgesic— Medicine used to relieve pain.\\nChronic pain— Pain that lasts more than three\\nmonths and threatens to disrupt daily life.\\nInflammation— Pain, redness, swelling, and heat\\nthat usually develop in response to injury or illness.\\nOsteoarthritis— Joint pain resulting from damage\\nto the cartilage.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 185\\nAnalgesics'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 215, 'page_label': '216'}, page_content='NSAIDs are effective analgesics even at doses too\\nlow to have any anti-inflammatory effects. There are a\\nnumber of chemical classes, but all have similar ther-\\napeutic effects and side effects. Most are appropriate\\nonly for oral administration; however ketorolac\\n(Toradol) is appropriate for injection and may be\\nused in moderate to severe pain for short periods.\\nAcetaminophen is a non-narcotic analgesic with no\\nanti-inflammatory properties. It is appropriate for mild\\nto moderate pain. Although the drug is well tolerated in\\nnormal doses, it may have significant toxicity at high\\ndoses. Because acetaminophen is largely free of side\\neffects at therapeutic doses, it has been considered the\\nfirst choice for mild pain, including that ofosteoarthritis.\\nTopical analgesics (topical being those that are\\napplied on the skin) have become much more popular\\nin recent years. Those applied for local effect include\\ncapsaicin, methylsalicylate, and transdermal lidocaine.\\nTransdermal fentanyl may be applied for systemic (the\\nentire body in general) effect. In some cases, these\\ntopical agents reduce the need for drug therapy. Sales\\nof pain relief patches have increased substantially in\\nrecent years. They are particularly useful for elderly\\npatients who may not want to take a lot of tablets.\\nRecommended dosage\\nAppropriate dosage varies by drug, and should\\nconsider the type of pain, as well as other risks asso-\\nciated with patient age and condition. For example,\\nnarcotic analgesics should usually be avoided in\\npatients with a history ofsubstance abuse, but may be\\nfully appropriate in patients withcancerpain. Similarly,\\nbecause narcotics are more rapidly metabolized in\\npatients who have used these drugs for a long period,\\nhigher than normal doses may be needed to provide\\nadequate pain management.

NSAIDS may\\nbe hazardous to patients with ulcers or an ulcer his-\\ntory. They should be used with care in patients with\\nrenal insufficiency orcoagulation disorders. NSAIDs\\nare contraindicated in patients allergic toaspirin.\\nSide effects\\nEach drug’s adverse effects should be reviewed\\nindividually. Drugs within a class may vary in their\\nfrequency and severity of adverse effects.\\nT h ep r i m a r ya d v e r s ee f f e c t so ft h en a r c o t i c\\nanalgesics are addiction, constipation, and respira-\\ntory depression. Because narcotic analgesics stimu-\\nlate the production of enzymes that cause the\\nmetabolism of these drugs,patients on narcotics for\\na prolonged period may require increasing doses.\\nThis is not the same thing as addiction, and is not a\\nreason for withholding medication from patients in\\nsevere pain.\\nNSAIDs can lead to ulcers and may cause kid-\\nney problems. Gastrointestinal discomfort is com-\\nmon, although in some cases, these drugs may\\ncause ulcers without the prior warning of gastroin-\\ntestinal distress.

Unlike other aller-\\ngic reactions, however, anaphylaxis can kill.

In\\nsevere cases, it can result in complete airway obstruc-\\ntion,shock,a n ddeath.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nLike the majority of other allergic reactions, ana-\\nphylaxis is caused by the release of histamine and\\nother chemicals from mast cells. Mast cells are a type\\nof white blood cell and they are found in large num-\\nbers in the tissues that regulate exchange with the\\nenvironment: the airways, digestive system, and skin.\\nOn their surfaces, mast cells display antibodies\\ncalled IgE (immunoglobulin type E). These antibodies\\nare designed to detect environmental substances to\\nwhich the immune system is sensitive. Substances\\nfrom a genuinely threatening source, such as bacteria\\nor viruses, are called antigens. A substance that most\\npeople tolerate well, but to which others have an aller-\\ngic response, is called an allergen. When IgE antibo-\\ndies bind with allergens, they cause the mast cell to\\nrelease histamine and other chemicals, which spill out\\nonto neighboring cells.\\nThe interaction of these chemicals with receptors\\non the surface of blood vessels causes the vessels to\\nleak fluid into surrounding tissues, causing fluid accu-\\nmulation, redness, and swelling. On the smooth mus-\\ncle cells of the airways and digestive system, they cause\\nconstriction. On nerve endings, they increase sensitiv-\\nity and causeitching.\\nIn anaphylaxis, the dramatic response is due both\\nto extreme hypersensivity to the allergen and its usually\\nsystemic distribution. Allergens are more likely to cause\\nanaphylaxis if they are introduced directly into the\\ncirculatory system by injection. However, exposure by\\ningestion, inhalation, or skin contact can also cause\\nanaphylaxis.

February 20, 1998. <http://\\nwww.merck.com>.\\nRichard Robinson\\nAnemias\\nDefinition\\nAnemia is a condition characterized by abnor-\\nmally low levels of healthy red blood cells or hemoglo-\\nbin (the component of red blood cells that delivers\\noxygen to tissues throughout the body).\\nDescription\\nThe tissues of the human body need a regular\\nsupply of oxygen to stay healthy. Red blood cells,\\nwhich contain hemoglobin that allows them to deliver\\noxygen throughout the body, live for only about 120\\ndays. When they die, the iron they contain is returned\\nto the bone marrow and used to create new red blood\\ncells. Anemia develops when heavy bleeding causes\\nsignificant iron loss or when something happens to\\nslow down the production of red blood cells or to\\nincrease the rate at which they are destroyed.\\nTypes of anemia\\nAnemia can be mild, moderate, or severe enough\\nto lead to life-threatening complications. More than\\n400 different types of anemia have been identified.\\nMany of them are rare.\\nIRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. The onset of iron defi-\\nciency anemia is gradual and, at first, there may not be\\nany symptoms. The deficiency begins when the body\\nloses more iron than it derives from food and other\\nsources. Because depleted iron stores cannot meet the\\nred blood cell’s needs, fewer red blood cells develop. In\\nthis early stage of anemia, the red blood cells look\\nnormal, but they are reduced in number. Then the\\nbody tries to compensate for the iron deficiency by\\nproducing more red blood cells, which are character-\\nistically small in size. Symptoms develop at this stage.\\nFOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Folic acid ane-\\nmia is especially common in infants and teenagers.\\nAlthough this condition usually results from a dietary\\ndeficiency, it is sometimes due to inability to absorb\\nenough folic acid from such foods as:\\n/C15cheese\\n/C15eggs\\n/C15fish\\n/C15green vegetables\\n/C15meat\\n/C15milk\\n/C15mushrooms\\n/C15yeast\\n192 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAnemias'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 222, 'page_label': '223'}, page_content='Smoking raises the risk of developing this condi-\\ntion by interfering with the absorption of Vitamin C,\\nwhich the body needs to absorb folic acid. Folic acid\\nanemia can be a complication ofpregnancy, when a\\nwoman’s body needs eight times more folic acid than it\\ndoes otherwise.\\nVITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Less common in\\nthis country than folic acid anemia, vitamin B12 defi-\\nciency anemia is another type of megaloblastic anemia\\nthat develops when the body doesn’t absorb enough of\\nthis nutrient. Necessary for the creation of red blood\\ncells, B12 is found in meat and vegetables.\\nLarge amounts of B12 are stored in the body, so this\\ncondition may not become apparent until as much as\\nfour years after B12 absorption stops or slows down. The\\nresulting drop in red blood cell production can cause:\\n/C15loss of muscle control\\n/C15loss of sensation in the legs, hands, and feet\\n/C15soreness or burning of the tongue\\n/C15weight loss\\n/C15yellow-blue color blindness\\nThe most common form of B12 deficiency isperni-\\ncious anemia. Since most people who eat meat or eggs\\nget enough B12 in theirdiets, a deficiency of this vita-\\nmin usually means that the body is not absorbing it\\nproperly. This can occur among people who have had\\nintestinal surgery or among those who do not produce\\nadequate amounts of intrinsic factor, a chemical\\nsecreted by the stomach lining that combines with\\nB12 to help its absorption in the small intestine.\\nPernicious anemia usually strikes between the ages\\nof 50–60.

Some people are born with\\nhemolytic anemia. Some acquire this condition, in\\nwhich infection or antibodies destroy red blood cells\\nmore rapidly than bone marrow can replace them.\\nHemolytic anemia can enlarge the spleen, acceler-\\nating the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis).\\nOther complications of hemolytic anemia include:\\n/C15pain\\n/C15shock\\n/C15gallstones and other serious health problems\\nTHALASSEMIAS. An inherited form of hemolytic\\nanemia, thalassemia stems from the body’s inability\\nto manufacture as much normal hemoglobin as it\\nneeds. There are two categories of thalassemia,\\ndepending on which of the amino acid chains is\\naffected. (Hemoglobin is composed of four chains of\\namino acids.) In alpha-thalassemia, there is an imbal-\\nance in the production of the alpha chain of amino\\nacids; in beta-thalassemia, there is an imbalance in the\\nbeta chain. Alpha-thalassemias most commonly affect\\nblacks (25% have at least one gene); beta-thalassemias\\nmost commonly affect people of Mediterranean ances-\\ntry and Southeast Asians.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAplastic— Exhibiting incomplete or faulty\\ndevelopment.\\nHemoglobin— An iron-containing pigment of red\\nblood cells composed of four amino acid chains\\n(alpha, beta, gamma, delta) that delivers oxygen\\nfrom the lungs to the tissues of the body.\\nMegaloblast— A large erythroblast (a red marrow\\ncell that synthesizes hemoglobin).\\nAn illustration of normal red blood cells (left) and those in\\nthree different types of anemia (from left), iron-deficiency\\nanemia, megaloblastic anemia, and sickle cell anemia.\\n(Illustration by John Bavosi, Custom Medical Stock Photo.\\nReproduced by permission.)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 193\\nAnemias'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 223, 'page_label': '224'}, page_content='Characterized by production of red blood cells\\nthat are unusually small and fragile, thalassemia only\\naffects people who inherit the gene for it from each\\nparent (autosomal recessive inheritance).\\nAUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS. Warm anti-\\nbody hemolytic anemia is the most common type of\\nthis disorder. This condition occurs when the body\\nproduces autoantibodies that coat red blood cells.\\nThe coated cells are destroyed by the spleen, liver, or\\nbone marrow.\\nWarm antibody hemolytic anemia is more com-\\nmon in women than in men. About one-third of\\npatients who have warm antibody hemolytic anemia\\nalso have lymphoma, leukemia, lupus, or connective\\ntissue disease.\\nIn cold antibody hemolytic anemia, the body\\nattacks red blood cells at or below normal body tem-\\nperature. The acute form of this condition frequently\\ndevelops in people who have hadpneumonia, mono-\\nneucleosis, or other acute infections. It tends to be\\nmild and short-lived, and disappears without\\ntreatment.\\nChronic cold antibody hemolytic anemia is most\\ncommon in women and most often affects those who\\nare over 40 and who have arthritis. This condition\\nusually lasts for a lifetime, generally causing few symp-\\ntoms. However, exposure to cold temperatures can\\naccelerate red blood cell destruction, causingfatigue,\\njoint aches, and discoloration of the arms and hands.\\nSICKLE CELL ANEMIA. Sickle cell anemia is a\\nchronic, incurable condition that causes the body to\\nproduce defective hemoglobin, which forces red blood\\ncells to assume an abnormal crescent shape. Unlike\\nnormal oval cells, fragile sickle cells can’t hold enough\\nhemoglobin to nourish body tissues. The deformed\\nshape makes it hard for sickle cells to pass through\\nnarrow blood vessels. When capillaries become\\nobstructed, a life-threatening condition called sickle\\ncell crisis is likely to occur.\\nSickle cell anemia is hereditary. It almost always\\naffects blacks and people of Mediterranean descent. A\\nchild who inherits the sickle cell gene from each parent\\nwill have the disease. A child who inherits the sickle\\ncell gene from only one parent carries the sickle cell\\ntrait, but does not have the disease.\\nAPLASTIC ANEMIA. Sometimes curable by bone\\nmarrow transplant, but potentially fatal,aplastic ane-\\nmia is characterized by decreased production of red\\nand white blood cells and platelets (disc-shaped cells\\nthat allow the blood to clot). This disorder may be\\ninherited or acquired as a result of:\\n/C15recent severe illness\\n/C15long-term exposure to industrial chemicals\\n/C15use ofanticancer drugsand certain other medications\\nANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE. Cancer, chronic\\ninfection or inflammation, and kidney andliver dis-\\nease often cause mild or moderate anemia. Chronic\\nliver failure generally produces the most severe symp-\\ntoms. People infected with the Humanimmunodefi-\\nciency virus (HIV) that causesAIDS often face severe\\nfatigue.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnemia is caused by bleeding, decreased red\\nblood cell production, or increased red blood cell\\ndestruction. Poor diet can contribute to vitamin defi-\\nciency and iron deficiency anemias in which fewer red\\nblood cells are produced. Hereditary disorders and\\ncertain diseases can cause increased blood cell destruc-\\ntion. However, excessive bleeding is the most common\\ncause of anemia, and the speed with which blood loss\\noccurs has a significant effect on the severity of symp-\\ntoms. Chronic blood loss is usually a consequence of:\\n/C15cancer\\n/C15gastrointestinal tumors\\n/C15diverticulosis\\n/C15polyposis\\n/C15heavy menstrual flow\\n/C15hemorrhoids\\n/C15nosebleeds\\n/C15stomach ulcers\\n/C15long-standing alcohol abuse\\nAcute blood loss is usually the result of:\\n/C15childbirth\\n/C15injury\\n/C15a ruptured blood vessel\\n/C15surgery\\nWhen a lot of blood is lost within a short time,\\nblood pressure and the amount of oxygen in the body\\ndrop suddenly.Heart failureand death can follow.\\nLoss of even one-third of the body’s blood volume\\nin the space of several hours can be fatal. More gra-\\ndual blood loss is less serious, because the body has\\ntime to create new red blood cells to replace those that\\nhave been lost.\\n194 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAnemias'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 224, 'page_label': '225'}, page_content='Symptoms\\nWeakness, fatigue, and a run-down feeling may be\\nsigns of mild anemia.

Since then, general anesthesia has become much\\nmore sophisticated. During most surgical procedures,\\nanesthetic agents are now delivered and controlled by\\ncomputerized equipment that includes anesthetic gas\\nmonitoring as well as patient monitoring equipment.\\nAnesthesiologists are the physicians that specialize in\\nthe delivery of anesthetic agents. Currently used inhaled\\ngeneral anesthetics include halothane, enflurane, isoflur-\\nane, desfluorane, sevofluorane, and nitrous oxide.\\n/C15Halothane (Fluothane) is a powerful anesthetic and\\ncan easily be overadministered. This drug causes\\nunconsciousness but little pain relief so it is often\\nused with other agents to control pain. Very rarely,\\nit can be toxic to the liver in adults, causing death. It\\nalso has the potential for causing serious cardiac\\ndysrhythmias. Halothane has a pleasant odor, and\\nwas frequently the anesthetic of choice for use with\\nchildren, but since the introduction of sevofluorane\\nin the 1990s, halothane use has declined.\\n/C15Enflurane (Ethrane) is less potent and results in a\\nmore rapid onset of anesthesia and faster awakening\\nthan halothane. In addition, it acts as an enhancer of\\nparalyzing agents. Enflurane has been found to\\nincrease intracranial pressure and the risk of seizures;\\ntherefore, its use is contraindicated in patients with\\nseizure disorders.\\n/C15Isoflurane (Forane) is not toxic to the liver but can\\ncause some cardiac irregularities. Isofluorane is often\\nused in combination with intravenous anesthetics for\\nanesthesia induction. Awakening from anesthesia is\\nfaster than it is with halothane and enfluorane.\\n/C15Desfluorane (Suprane) may increase the heart rate\\nand should not be used in patients withaortic valve\\nstenosis; however, it does not usually cause heart\\narrhythmias. Desflurane may cause coughing and exci-\\ntation during induction and is therefore used with\\nintravenous anesthetics for induction. Desflurane is\\nrapidly eliminated and awakening is therefore faster\\nthan with other inhaled agents.\\n/C15Sevofluorane (Ultane) m ay also cause increased\\nheart rate and should not be used in patients with\\nnarrowed aortic valve (stenosis); however, it does\\nnot usually cause heart arrhythmias. Unlike des-\\nfluorane, sevofluorane does not cause any coughing\\nor other related side effects, and can therefore be\\nused without intravenous agents for rapid induc-\\ntion. For this reason, sevofluorane is replacing\\nhalothane for induction in pediatric patients. Like\\ndesfluorane, this agent is rapidly eliminated and\\nallows rapid awakening.\\n/C15Nitrous oxide (laughing gas) is a weak anesthetic and\\nis used with other agents, such as thiopental, to\\nproduce surgical anesthesia. It has the fastest induc-\\ntion and recovery and is the safest because it does not\\nslow breathing or blood flow to the brain. However,\\nit diffuses rapidly into air-containing cavities and can\\nresult in a collapsed lung (pneumothorax) or lower\\nthe oxygen contents of tissues (hypoxia).\\nCommonly administered intravenous anesthetic\\nagents include ketamine, thiopental, opioids, and\\npropofol.\\n/C15Ketamine (Ketalar) affects the senses, and produces\\na dissociative anesthesia (catatonia, amnesia, analge-\\nsia) in which the patient may appear awake and\\nreactive, but cannot respond to sensory stimuli.\\nThese properties make it especially useful for use in\\ndeveloping countries and during warfare medical\\ntreatment. Ketamine is frequently used in pediatric\\npatients because anesthesia and analgesia can be\\nachieved with an intramuscular injection. It is also\\nused in high-risk geriatric patients and inshock cases,\\nbecause it also provides cardiac stimulation.\\n/C15Thiopental (Pentothal) is a barbiturate that induces\\na rapid hypnotic state of short duration. Because\\nthiopental is slowly metabolized by the liver, toxic\\naccumulation can occur; therefore, it should not be\\ncontinuously infused. Side effects includenausea and\\nvomiting upon awakening.\\n/C15Opioids include fentanyl, sufentanil, and alfentanil,\\nand are frequently used prior to anesthesia and sur-\\ngery as a sedative and analgesic, as well as a continu-\\nous infusion for primary anesthesia. Because opioids\\nrarely affect the cardiovascular system, they are par-\\nticularly useful for cardiac surgery and other high-\\nrisk cases. Opioids act directly on spinal cord recep-\\ntors, and are freqently used in epidurals for spinal\\nanesthesia. Side effects may includenausea and\\nvomiting, itching, and respiratory depression.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 199\\nAnesthesia, general'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 229, 'page_label': '230'}, page_content='/C15Propofol (Diprivan) is a nonbarbiturate hypnotic\\nagent and the most recently developed intravenous\\nanesthetic.

Some of these risks can be minimized by ensuring\\nthat the physician and anesthesiologist are fully\\ninformed of the detailed health condition of the\\npatient, including any drugs that he or she may be\\nusing. Older people are especially sensitive to the\\neffects of certain anesthetics and may be more likely\\nto experience side effects from these drugs.\\nPatients who have had general anesthesia should\\nnot drink alcoholic beverages or take medication that\\nslow down the central nervous system (such asantihis-\\ntamines, sedatives, tranquilizers, sleep aids, certain pain\\nrelievers, muscle relaxants, and anti-seizure medica-\\ntion) for at least 24 hours, except under a doctor’s care.\\nSpecial conditions\\nPeople with certain medical conditions are at greater\\nrisk of developing problems with anesthetics. Before\\nundergoing general anesthesia, anyone with the follow-\\ning conditions should absolutely inform their doctor.\\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had allergic or other\\nunusual reactions tobarbituratesor general anesthetics\\nin the past should notify the doctor before having gen-\\neral anesthesia. In particular, people who have had\\nmalignant hyperthermia or whose family members\\nhave had malignant hyperthermia during or after\\nbeing given an anesthetic should inform the physician.\\nSigns of malignant hyperthermia include rapid, irregu-\\nlar heartbeat, breathing problems, very highfever,a n d\\nmuscle tightness or spasms. These symptoms can occur\\nfollowing the administration of general anesthesia\\nusing inhaled agents, especially halothane. In addition,\\nthe doctor should also be told about any allergies to\\nfoods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.\\nPREGNANCY. The effects of anesthetics on preg-\\nnant women and fetuses vary, depending on the type\\nof drug. In general, giving large amounts of general\\nanesthetics to the mother during labor and delivery\\nmay make the baby sluggish after delivery. Pregnant\\nwomen should discuss the use of anesthetics during\\nlabor and delivery with their doctors. Pregnant women\\nwho may be given general anesthesia for other medical\\nprocedures should ensure that the treating physician is\\ninformed about thepregnancy.\\nBREASTFEEDING.

As a result, regional anesthesia may be used\\nfor more involved or complicated surgical or medical\\nprocedures. Regional anesthetics are injected. Local\\nanesthesia involves the injection into the skin or mus-\\ncle or application to the skin of an anesthetic directly\\nwhere pain will occur. Local anesthesia can be divided\\ninto four groups: injectable, topical, dental (non-\\ninjectable), and ophthalmic.\\nLocal and regional anesthesia work by altering the\\nflow of sodium molecules into nerve cells or neurons\\nthrough the cell membrane. Exactly how the anes-\\nthetic does this is not understood, since the drug\\napparently does not bind to any receptor on the cell\\nsurface and does not seem to affect the release of\\nchemicals that transmit nerve impulses (neurotrans-\\nmitters) from the nerve cells. It is known, however,\\nthat when the sodium molecules do not get into the\\nneurons, nerve impulses are not generated and pain\\nimpulses are not transmitted to the brain. The dura-\\ntion of action of an anesthetic depends on the type and\\namount of anesthetic administered.\\nRegional anesthesia\\nTypes of regional anesthesia include:\\n/C15Spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia involves the\\ninjection of a small amount of local anesthetic\\ndirectly into the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the\\nspinal cord (the subarachnoid space). Blood pressure\\ndrops are common but are easily treated.\\n/C15Epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia involves\\nthe injection of a large volume of local anesthetic\\ndirectly into the space surrounding the spinal fluid\\nsac (the epidural space), not into the spinal fluid.\\nPain relief occurs more slowly but is less likely to\\nproduce blood pressure drops. Also, the block can be\\nmaintained for long periods, even days.\\n/C15Nerve blocks. Nerve blocks involve the injection of\\nan anesthetic into the area around a nerve that sup-\\nplies a particular region of the body, preventing the\\nnerve from carrying nerve impulses to the brain.\\nAnesthetics may be administered with another\\ndrug, such as epinephrine (adrenaline), which decreases\\nbleeding, and sodium bicarbonate to decrease the acid-\\nity of a drug so that it will work faster. In addition,\\ndrugs may be administered to help a patient remain\\ncalm and more comfortable or to make them sleepy.\\nLocal anesthesia\\nINJECTABLE LOCAL ANESTHETICS.

Topical anesthetics, such\\nas benzocaine, lidocaine, dibucaine, pramoxine,\\nbutamben, and tetracaine, relieve pain and itching by\\ndeadening the nerve endings in the skin. They are\\ningredients in a variety of nonprescription products\\nthat are applied to the skin to relieve the discomfort of\\nsunburn, insect bites or stings, poison ivy, and minor\\ncuts, scratches, andburns. These products are sold as\\ncreams, ointments, sprays, lotions, and gels.\\nDENTAL ANESTHETICS (NON-INJECTABLE). Some\\nlocal anesthetics are intended for pain relief in the\\nmouth or throat. They may be used to relieve throat\\npain, teething pain, painful canker sores, toothaches,\\nor discomfort from dentures, braces, or bridgework.\\nSome dental anesthetics are available only with a doc-\\ntor’s prescription. Others may be purchased without a\\nprescription, including products such as Num-Zit,\\nOrajel, Chloraseptic lozenges, and Xylocaine.\\nOPHTHALMIC ANESTHETICS. Other local anes-\\nthetics are designed for use in the eye. The ophthalmic\\nanesthetics proparacaine and tetracaine are used to\\nnumb the eye before certain eye examinations. Eye\\ndoctors may also use these medicines before measur-\\ning eye pressure or removing stitches orforeign objects\\nfrom the eye. These drugs are to be given only by a\\ntrained health care professional.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nlocal anesthetic and the purpose for which it is being\\nused. When using a nonprescription local anesthetic,\\nfollow the directions on the package. Questions con-\\ncerning how to use a product should be referred to a\\nmedical doctor, dentist, or pharmacist.\\nPrecautions\\nPeople who strongly feel that they cannot psycho-\\nlogically cope with being awake and alert during cer-\\ntain procedures may not be good candidates for local\\nor regional anesthesia. Other medications may be\\ngiven in conjunction with the anesthetic, however, to\\nrelieveanxiety and help the patient relax.\\nLocal anesthetics should be used only for the con-\\nditions for which they are intended. For example, a\\ntopical anesthetic meant to relieve sunburn pain\\nshould not be used on cold sores. Anyone who has\\nhad an unusual reaction to any local anesthetic in the\\npast should check with a doctor before using any type\\nof local anesthetic again. The doctor should also be\\ntold about anyallergies to foods, dyes, preservatives,\\nor other substances.\\nOlder people may be more sensitive to the effects\\nof local anesthetics, especially lidocaine.

People who are 50-80 years old are most\\nlikely to develop an aortic aneurysm, with men four\\ntimes more likely to develop one than women.\\nAn aortic aneurysm develops and grows slowly. It\\nrarely produces symptoms and is usually only diag-\\nnosed by accident during a routine physical exam or\\non an x ray or ultrasound done for another reason. As\\nthe aneurysm grows larger, the risk of bursting with no\\nwarning, which causes catastrophic bleeding, rises. A\\nruptured aortic aneurysm can cause sudden loss of a\\nfatal amount of blood within minutes or it can leak in\\na series of small bleeds that lead within hours or days\\nto massive bleeding. A leaking aortic aneurysm that is\\nnot treated is always fatal.\\nAneurysmectomy is performed to repair the two\\nmost common types of aortic aneurysms: abdominal\\naortic aneurysms that occur in the abdomen below\\nthe kidneys, and thoracic aortic aneurysms that occur\\nin the chest. It is major surgery performed in a hospital\\nunder general anesthesiaand involves removing debris\\nand then implanting a flexibletube (graft) to replace the\\nenlarged artery. Aneurysmectomy for an aneurysm of\\nthe ascending aorta (the firstpart of the aorta that travels\\nupward from the heart) requires the use of a heart-lung\\nmachine that temporarily stops the heart while the\\naneurysm is repaired. Aneurysmectomy requires a\\none-week hospital stay; the recovery period is five weeks.\\nDuring surgery, the site of the aneurysm (either\\nthe abdomen or the chest) is opened with an incision to\\nexpose the aneurysm. The aorta is clamped above and\\nbelow the aneurysm to stop the flow of blood.

It is\\nalso sometimes characterized by a feeling ofchoking,\\nsuffocation, or crushing heaviness. This condition is\\nalso called angina pectoris.\\nDescription\\nOften described as a muscle spasm and choking\\nsensation, the term ‘‘angina’’ is used primarily to\\ndescribe chest (thoracic) pain originating from insuffi-\\ncient oxygen to the heart muscle. An episode of angina\\nis not an actualheart attack, but rather pain that results\\nfrom the heart muscle temporarily receiving too little\\nblood. This temporary condition may be the result of\\ndemanding activities such asexercise and does not\\nnecessarily indicate that the heart muscle is experienc-\\ning permanent damage. In fact, episodes of angina\\nseldom cause permanent damage to heart muscle.\\nAngina can be subdivided further into two cate-\\ngories: angina of effort and variant angina.\\nAngina of effort\\nAngina of effort is a common disorder caused by\\nthe narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) that\\nsupply oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle. In the\\ncase of angina of effort, the heart (coronary) arteries\\ncan provide the heart muscle (myocardium) adequate\\nblood during rest but not during periods of exercise,\\nstress, or excitement–any of which may precipitate\\npain. The pain is relieved by resting or by administer-\\ning nitroglycerin, a medication that reduces ischemia\\nof the heart. Patients with angina of effort have an\\nincreased risk of heart attack (myocardial infarction).\\nVariant angina\\nVariant angina is uncommon and occurs indepen-\\ndently of atherosclerosis which may, however, be pre-\\nsent as an incidental finding. Variant angina occurs at\\nrest and is not related to excessive work by the heart\\nmuscle. Research indicates that variant angina is\\ncaused by coronary artery muscle spasm of insufficient\\nduration or intensity to cause an actual heart attack.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAngina causes a pressing pain or sensation of\\nheaviness, usually in the chest area under the breast\\n206 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAngina'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 236, 'page_label': '237'}, page_content='bone (sternum). It occasionally is experienced in the\\nshoulder, arm, neck, or jaw regions. Because episodes\\nof angina occur when the heart’s need for oxygen\\nincreases beyond the oxygen available from the\\nblood nourishing the heart, the condition is often pre-\\ncipitated by physical exertion. In most cases, the symp-\\ntoms are relieved within a few minutes by resting or by\\ntaking prescribed angina medications. Emotional\\nstress, extreme temperatures, heavy meals, cigarette\\nsmoking, and alcohol can also cause or contribute to\\nan episode of angina.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysicians can usually diagnose angina based on\\nthe patient’s symptoms and the precipitating factors.\\nHowever, other diagnostic testing is often required to\\nconfirm or rule out angina, or to determine the sever-\\nity of the underlying heart disease.\\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\\nAn electrocardiogram is a test that records elec-\\ntrical impulses from the heart. The resulting graph of\\nelectrical activity can show if the heart muscle isn’t\\nfunctioning properly as a result of a lack of oxygen.\\nElectrocardiograms are also useful in investigating\\nother possible abnormal features of the heart.\\nStress test\\nFor many individuals with angina, the results of\\nan electrocardiogram while at rest will not show any\\nabnormalities. Because the symptoms of angina occur\\nduring stress, the functioning of the heart may need to\\nbe evaluated under the physical stress of exercise. The\\nstress testrecords information from the electrocardio-\\ngram before, during, and after exercise in search of\\nstress-related abnormalities. Blood pressure is also\\nmeasured during the stress test and symptoms are\\nnoted. A more involved and complex stress test (for\\nexample, thallium scanning) may be used in some\\ncases to picture the blood flow in the heart muscle\\nduring the most intense time of exercise and after rest.\\nAngiogram\\nThe angiogram, which is basically an x ray of the\\ncoronary artery, has been noted to be the most accu-\\nrate diagnostic test to indicate the presence and extent\\nof coronary disease. In this procedure, a long, thin,\\nflexible tube (catheter) is maneuvered into an artery\\nlocated in the forearm or groin. This catheter is passed\\nfurther through the artery into one of the two major\\ncoronary arteries. A dye is injected at that time to help\\nthe x rays ‘‘see’’ the heart and arteries more clearly.\\nMany brief x rays are made to create a ‘‘movie’’ of\\nblood flowing through the coronary arteries, which\\nwill reveal any possible narrowing that causes a\\ndecrease in blood flow to the heart muscle and asso-\\nciated symptoms of angina.\\nTreatment\\nConservative treatment\\nArtery disease causing angina is addressed initi-\\nally by controlling existing factors placing the indivi-\\ndual at risk. These risk factors include cigarette\\nsmoking, high blood pressure,high cholesterollevels,\\nand obesity. Angina is often controlled by medication,\\nmost commonly with nitroglycerin. This drug relieves\\nsymptoms of angina by increasing the diameter of the\\nblood vessels carrying blood to the heart muscle.\\nNitroglycerin is taken whenever discomfort occurs or\\nis expected. It may be taken by mouth by placing the\\ntablet under the tongue or transdermally by placing a\\nmedicated patch directly on the skin. In addition,beta\\nblockers or calcium channel blockersmay be prescribed\\nto also decrease the demand on the heart by decreasing\\nthe rate and workload of the heart.\\nSurgical treatment\\nWhen conservative treatments are not effective in\\nthe reduction of angina pain and the risk of heart\\nattack remains high, physicians may recommend\\nangioplasty or surgery. Coronary artery bypass sur-\\ngery is an operation in which a blood vessel (often a\\nlong vein surgically removed from the leg) is grafted\\nonto the blocked artery to bypass the blocked portion.\\nThis newly formed pathway allows blood to flow ade-\\nquately to the heart muscle.\\nAnother procedure used to improve blood flow to\\nthe heart is balloon angioplasty. In this procedure, the\\nKEY TERMS\\nIschemia — Decreased blood supply to an organ or\\nbody part, often resulting in pain.\\nMyocardial infarction — A blockage of a coronary\\nartery that cuts off the blood supply to part of the\\nheart.

Atherosclerosis, a major asso-\\nciated cause, requires diet and lifestyle adjustments,\\nprimarily including regular exercise, reduction of diet-\\nary sugar and saturated fats, and increase of dietary\\nfiber. Both conventional and alternative medicine\\nagree that increasing exercise and improving diet are\\nimportant steps to reduce high cholesterol levels.\\nAlternative medicine has proposed specific choles-\\nterol-lowering treatments, with several gaining the\\nattention and interest of the public. One of the most\\nrecent popular treatments is garlic (Allium sativum ).\\nSome studies have shown that adequate dosages of\\ngarlic can reduce total cholesterol by about 10%,\\nLDL (bad) cholesterol by 15%, and raise HDL\\n(good) cholesterol by 10%. Other studies have not\\nshown significant benefit. Although its effect on cho-\\nlesterol is not as great as that achieved by medications,\\ngarlic may possibly be of benefit in relatively mild\\ncases of high cholesterol, without causing the side\\neffects associated withcholesterol-reducing drugs .\\nOther herbal remedies that may help lower cholesterol\\ninclude alfalfa (Medicago sativa ), fenugreek\\n(Trigonella foenum-graecum ), Asian ginseng (Panax\\nginseng), and tumeric (Curcuma longa ).\\nAntioxidants, including vitamin A (beta carotene),\\nvitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium, can limit the oxi-\\ndative damage to the walls of blood vessels that may\\nbe a precursor of atherosclerotic plaque formation.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for a patient with angina depends\\non its origin, type, severity, and the general health of\\nthe individual. A person who has angina has the best\\nprognosis if he or she seeks prompt medical attention\\nand learns the pattern of his or her angina, such as\\nwhat causes the attacks, what they feel like, how long\\nepisodes usually last, and whether medication relieves\\nthe attacks. If patterns of the symptoms change sig-\\nnificantly, or if symptoms resemble those of a heart\\nattack, medical help should be sought immediately.\\nPrevention\\nIn most cases, the best prevention involves chan-\\nging one’s habits to avoid bringing on attacks of\\nangina. If blood pressure medication has been pre-\\nscribed, compliance is a necessity and should be a\\npriority as well. Many healthcare professionals–\\nincluding physicians, dietitians, and nurses–can pro-\\nvide valuable advice on proper diet, weight control,\\nblood cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. These\\nprofessionals also offer suggestions about current\\ntreatments and information to help stop smoking.

First, a\\nsmall incision is made in the skin to help the needle pass.\\nA needle containing an inner wire called a stylet is\\ninserted through the skin into the artery. When the radi-\\nologist has punctured the artery with the needle, the\\nstylet is removed and replaced with another long wire\\ncalled a guide wire. It is normal for blood to spout out of\\nthe needle before the guide wire is inserted.\\nThe guide wire is fed through the outer needle into\\nthe artery and to the area that requires angiographic\\nstudy. A fluoroscopic screen that displays a view of the\\npatient’s vascular system is used to pilot the wire to the\\ncorrect location. Once it is in position, the needle is\\nremoved and a catheter is slid over the length of the\\nguide wire until it to reaches the area of study.

An\\nautomatic injector is used frequently because it is able\\nto propel a large volume of dye very quickly to the\\nangiogram site. The patient is warned that the injection\\nwill start, and instructed to remain very still. The injec-\\ntion causes some mild to moderate discomfort. Possible\\nside effects or reactions includeheadache, dizziness,\\nirregular heartbeat, nausea, warmth, burning sensa-\\ntion, and chestpain, but they usually last only momen-\\ntarily.

During any injection, the patient\\nor the camera may move.\\nThroughout the dye injection procedure, x-ray\\npictures and/or fluoroscopic pictures (or moving\\nx rays) will be taken. Because of the high pressure of\\narterial blood flow, the dye will dissipate through the\\npatient’s system quickly, so pictures must be taken in\\nrapid succession.

The\\ncatheter may also be placed in the left ventricle to\\nexamine the mitral and aortic valves of the heart. If\\nthe cardiologist requires a view of the right ventricle of\\nthe heart or of the tricuspid or pulmonic valves, the\\ncatheter will be inserted through a large vein and\\nguided into the right ventricle. The catheter also serves\\nthe purpose of monitoring blood pressures in these\\ndifferent locations inside the heart. The angiogram\\nprocedure takes several hours, depending on the com-\\nplexity of the procedure.\\nPulmonary angiography\\nPulmonary, or lung, angiography is performed to\\nevaluate blood circulation to the lungs.

Throughout the\\nprocedure, the patient’s vital signs are monitored to\\nensure that the catheter doesn’t causearrhythmias,o r\\nirregular heartbeats. The contrast medium is then\\ninjected into the pulmonary artery where it circulates\\nthrough the lung capillaries. The test typically takes up\\nto 90 minutes.\\nKidney angiography\\nPatients with chronic renal disease or injury can\\nsuffer further damage to their kidneys from the con-\\ntrast medium used in a kidney angiogram, yet they\\noften require the test to evaluate kidney function.\\nThese patients should be well-hydrated with a intrave-\\nnous saline drip before the procedure, and may benefit\\nfrom available medications (e.g., dopamine) that help\\nto protect the kidney from further injury due to con-\\ntrast agents. During a kidney angiogram, the guide\\nwire and catheter are inserted into the femoral artery\\nin the groin area and advanced through the abdominal\\naorta, the main artery in the abdomen, and into the\\nrenal arteries. The procedure will take approximately\\none hour.\\nFluorescein angiography\\nFluorescein angiography is used to diagnose ret-\\ninal problems and circulatory disorders. It is typically\\nconducted as an outpatient procedure. The patient’s\\npupils are dilated with eye drops and he rests his chin\\nand forehead against a bracing apparatus to keep it\\nstill. Sodium fluorescein dye is then injected with a\\nsyringe into a vein in the patient’s arm. The dye will\\ntravel through the patient’s body and into the blood\\nvessels of the eye. The procedure does not require\\nx rays. Instead, a rapid series of close-up photographs\\nof the patient’s eyes are taken, one set immediately\\nafter the dye is injected, and a second set approxi-\\nmately 20 minutes later once the dye has moved\\nthrough the patient’s vascular system. The entire\\nprocedure takes up to one hour.\\nCeliac and mesenteric angiography\\nCeliac and mesenteric angiography involves x-ray\\nexploration of the celiac and mesenteric arteries, arter-\\nial branches of the abdominal aorta that supply blood\\nto the abdomen and digestive system. The test is com-\\nmonly used to detect aneurysm, thrombosis, and signs\\nofischemia in the celiac and mesenteric arteries, and to\\nlocate the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is also\\nused in the diagnosis of a number of conditions,\\nincluding portalhypertension, andcirrhosis. The pro-\\ncedure can take up to three hours, depending on the\\nnumber of blood vessels studied.\\nSplenoportography\\nA splenoportograph is a variation of an angio-\\ngram that involves the injection of contrast medium\\ndirectly into the spleen to view the splenic and portal\\nveins. It is used to diagnose blockages in the splenic\\nvein and portal vein thrombosis and to assess the\\nstrength and location of the vascular system prior to\\nliver transplantation.\\nMost angiography procedures are typically paid\\nfor by major medical insurance. Patients should check\\nwith their individual insurance plans to determine\\ntheir coverage.\\nPreparation\\nPatients undergoing an angiogram are advised to\\nstop eating and drinking eight hours prior to the pro-\\ncedure. They must remove all jewelry before the pro-\\ncedure and change into a hospital gown. If the arterial\\npuncture is to be made in the armpit or groin area,\\nshaving may be required.

If the procedure is\\nperformed on an outpatient basis, the patient is typi-\\ncally kept under close observation for a period of at six\\nto 12 hours before being released. If the arterial punc-\\nture was performed in the femoral artery, the patient\\nwill be instructed to keep his leg straight and relatively\\nimmobile during the observation period.

For example, percutaneous trans-\\nluminal angioplasty (PTA) describes entry through\\nthe skin (percutaneous) and navigates to the area of\\nthe vessel of interest through the same vessel or one\\nthat communicates with it (transluminal). In the case\\nof a procedure involving the coronary arteries, the\\npoint of entry could be the femoral artery in the\\ngroin and the catheter/guidewire system is passed\\nthrough the aorta to the heart and the origin of the\\ncoronary arteries at the base of the aorta just outside\\nthe aortic valve.\\n212 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAngioplasty'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 242, 'page_label': '243'}, page_content='Purpose\\nIn individuals with an occulsive vascular disease\\nsuch asatherosclerosis, blood flow is impaired to an\\norgan (such as the heart) or to a distal body part ( such\\nas the lower leg) by the narrowing of the vessel’s lumen\\ndue to fatty deposits or calcium accumulation. This\\nnarrowing may occur in any vessel but may occur\\nanywhere. Once the vessel has been widened, adequate\\nblood flow is returned. The vessel may narrow again\\nover time at the same location and the procedure could\\nbe repeated.\\nPrecautions\\nAngioplasty procedures are performed on hos-\\npital inpatients in facilities for proper monitoring\\nand recovery. If the procedure is to be performed\\nin a coronary artery, the patient’s care is likely to\\nbe provided by specially trained physicians, nurses,\\nand vascular specialists. Typically, patients are\\ngiven anticoagulants prior to the procedure to\\nassist in the prevention of thromboses (blood clots).\\nAdministration of anticoagulants, however, may\\nimpede the sealing of the vascular entry point. The\\nprocedure will be performed using fluoroscopic gui-\\ndance and contrast media.

Today, catheters contain balloons\\nthat are inflated to widen the vessel and stents to\\nprovide structural support for the vessel. Lasers may\\nbe used to assist in the break up of the fat or calcium\\nplaque.

Once the vessel is punctured and the guidewire\\nis introduced, fluoroscopy is used to monitor small\\ninjections of contrast media used to visualize the path\\nthrough the vessel. If the fluoroscopy system has a\\nfeature called ‘roadmap’, the amount of contrast\\nmedia injected will be greater in order to define the full\\nroute the guidewire will take. The fluoroscopy system\\nwill then superimpose subsequent images over the road-\\nmap while the vessel is traversed, that is, the physician\\nmoves the guidewire along the map to the destination.\\nHaving reached the area of stenosis, the physician\\nwill inflate the balloon on the catheter that has been\\npassed along the guidewire.

The pri-\\nmary function of ACE is to help regulate arterial\\npressure by converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II.\\nPurpose\\nThe ACE test is used primarily to detect and\\nmonitor the clinical course ofsarcoidosis (a disease\\nthat affects many organs, especially the lungs), to differ-\\nentiate between sarcoidosis and similar diseases, and to\\ndelineate between active and inactive sarcoid disease.\\nElevated ACE levels are also found in a number of\\nother conditions, including Gaucher’s disease (a rare\\nfamilial disorder of fat metabolism) andleprosy.\\nPrecautions\\nIt should be noted that people under 20 years of\\nage normally have very high ACE levels. Decreased\\nlevels may be seen in the condition of excess fat in the\\nblood (hyperlipidemia). Drugs that may cause\\ndecreased ACE levels include ACE inhibitor antihy-\\npertensives and steroids.\\nDescription\\nACE plays an important role in the renin/aldos-\\nterone mechanism which controls blood pressure by\\nconverting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, two pro-\\nteins involved in regulating blood pressure.\\nAngiotensin I by itself is inactive, but when converted\\nby ACE to the active form, angiotensin II, it causes\\nnarrowing of the small blood vessels in tissues, result-\\ning in an increase in blood pressure.

The saliva of dogs, cats, ferrets,\\nand rabbits is known to contain a wide variety of\\nbacteria. According to one recent study, bacteria or\\nother pathogens show up in about 85 percent of bites.\\nWhen an animal bites, it can then transmit pathogens\\ninto the wound. These microorganisms may grow\\nwithin the wound and cause an infection. The conse-\\nquences of infection range from mild discomfort to\\nlife-threatening complications.\\nDescription\\nTwo to 4.5 million animal bites occur each year in\\nthe United States; about 1% of these bites require\\nhospitalization. Animal bites result in 334,000 emer-\\ngency room visits per year, which represents approxi-\\nmately 1% of all emergency hospital visits, at an\\nannual cost of $100 million dollars in health care\\nexpenses and lost income. Children are the most fre-\\nquent victims of dog bites, with 5–9 year-old boys\\nhaving the highest incidence. Men are more often\\nbitten by dogs than are women (3:1), whereas women\\nare more often bitten by cats (3:1).\\nDog bites make up 80–85% of all reported inci-\\ndents. Cats account for about 10% of reported bites,\\nand other animals (including hamsters, ferrets, rab-\\nbits, horses, raccoons, bats, skunks, and monkeys)\\nmake up the remaining 5–10%. Cat bites become\\ninfected more frequently than dog bites. A dog’s\\nmouth is rich in bacteria, but only 15–20% of dog\\nbites become infected. In contrast, approximately\\n30–50% of cat bites become infected.\\nMany factors contribute to the infection rates,\\nincluding the type of wound inflicted, the location of\\nthe wound, pre-existing health conditions in the bitten\\nperson, the extent of delay before treatment, patient\\ncompliance and the presence of a foreign body in the\\nwound. Dogs usually inflict crush injuries because\\nthey have rounded teeth and strong jaws; thus, the\\nbite of an adult dog can exert up to 200 pounds per\\nsquare inch of pressure. This pressure usually results in\\na crushing injury, causing damage to such deep struc-\\ntures as bones, blood vessels, tendons, muscles, and\\nnerves. The canine teeth in a dog’s mouth are also\\nsharp and strong, often inflicting lacerations. Cats,\\nwith their needle-like incisors and carnassial teeth,\\ntypically cause puncturewounds. Puncture wounds\\nappear innocuous on the surface, but the underlying\\ninjury goes deep. Cat teeth essentially inject bacteria\\ninto the bite, and the deep, narrow wound is difficult\\nto clean. Persons with impaired immunocompe-\\ntence—for example, individuals with HIV infec-\\ntion—are especially vulnerable to infection from cat\\nbites. Lastly, bites or stings from marine creatures\\nKEY TERMS\\nSarcoidosis— Sarcoidosis is a rare disease of\\nunknown cause in which inflammation occurs in\\nlymph nodes and other tissues throughout the\\nbody, usually the lungs, skin, liver, and eyes.\\n218 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAnimal bite infections'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 248, 'page_label': '249'}, page_content='(sharks, rays, eels, etc.) require immediate medical\\nattention as these bites may contain disease organisms\\nunique to the ocean environment as well as causing\\nsevere loss of blood.\\nThe bacterial species most commonly found\\nin bite wounds include Pasteurella multocida ,\\nStaphylococcus aureus , Pseudomonas sp ,a n d\\nStreptococcus sp .

Dogs were first domesticated by humans\\nas early as 10,000B.C. for hunting and as guard or\\nattack dogs. Many species travel in packs or groups\\nin the wild, and many human fatalities resulting from\\ndog bites involve a large group of dogs attacking one\\nor two persons. In addition, dogs typically relate to\\nhumans according to a hierarchical model of domi-\\nnance and submission, and many of the techniques of\\ndog training are intended to teach the dog to respect\\nhuman authority. Certain breeds of dogs are much\\nmore likely to attack humans than others; those most\\noften involved in fatal attacks are pit bulls, Rottweilers,\\nGerman shepherds, huskies, and mastiffs. According to\\nthe Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there are\\nbetween 15 and 20 fatal dog attacks on humans in the\\nUnited States each year. There are several assessment\\nor evaluation scales that veterinarians or animal trai-\\nners can use to score individual or mixed-breed dogs\\nfor dominant or aggressive behavior.\\nUnlike dogs, cats were not domesticated until\\nabout 3000B.C., and were important to ancient civili-\\nzations as rodent catchers and household companions\\nrather than as protectors or hunters of wild game.\\nBiologists classify cats as solitary predators rather\\nthan as pack or herd animals; as a result, cats do not\\nrelate to humans as authority figures in the same way\\nthat dogs do, and they do not form groups that attack\\nhumans when threatened or provoked. In addition,\\ndomestic cats have been selectively bred for appear-\\nance rather than for fierceness or aggression. Most cat\\nbites are the result of fear on the cat’s part (as when\\nbeing placed in a carrier for a trip to the vet) or a\\nphenomenon known as petting-induced aggression.\\nPetting-induced aggression is a behavior in which a\\ncat that has been apparently enjoying contact with a\\nhuman suddenly turns on the human and bites. This\\nbehavior appears to be more common in cats that had\\nno contact with humans during their first seven weeks\\nof life. In other cats, this type of aggression appears to\\nbe related to a hypersensitive nervous system; petting\\nor cuddling that was pleasurable to the cat for a few\\nseconds or minutes becomes irritating, and the cat\\nbites as a way of indicating that it has had enough.\\nIn older cats, petting-induced aggression is often a sign\\nthat the cat feelspain from touching or pressure on\\narthritic joints in its neck or back.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common sign of infection from an ani-\\nmal bite is inflammation. The skin around the wound\\nis red and feels warm, and the wound may exude pus.\\nNearby lymph glands may be swollen. Complications\\ncan arise if the infection is not treated and spreads into\\ndeeper structures or into the bloodstream. If the bite is\\ndeep or occurs on the hand or at a joint, complications\\nare more likely.\\nLive disease-causing bacteria within the blood-\\nstream and tissues cause complications far from the\\nwound site. Such complications include meningitis,\\nbrain abscesses,pneumonia and lung abscesses, and\\nheart infections, among others. These complications\\ncan be fatal. Deep bites or bites near joints can damage\\njoints and bones, causing inflammation of the bone\\nand bone marrow or septic arthritis.\\nCat-scratch disease is caused by Bartonella\\nhenselae, a bacterium that is carried in cat saliva;\\ninfection may be transmitted by a bite or scratch.\\nApproximately 22,000 cases are reported each year in\\nthe United States; worldwide, nine out of every\\n100,000 individuals become infected. More than 80%\\nof reported cases occur in persons under the age of 21.\\nThe disease is not normally severe in individuals with\\nhealthy immune systems. Symptoms may become ser-\\nious, however, in immunocompromised individuals,\\nsuch as those with acquired immune deficiency\\nsyndrome (AIDS) or those undergoingchemotherapy.\\nCommon symptoms include an inflamed sore in the\\narea of the bite or scratch, swollen lymph nodes,fever,\\nfatigue, and rash.\\nRabies is caused by a virus that is transmitted\\nthrough the bite of an animal that is already\\ninfected. It is classified as a zoonosis,w h i c hi sa\\nterm that refers to any disease of animals that can\\nbe transmitted to humans. More than 90% of animal\\nrabies cases occur in such wild animals as skunks,\\nbats, and raccoons, with such domestic animals as\\ndogs and cats accounting for fewer than 10% of\\ncases. The World Health Organization (WHO) esti-\\nmates that between 35,000 and 50,000 individuals\\nworldwide die each year as a result of rabies. The\\nhighest incidence of rabies occurs in Asia where, in\\n1997, over 33,000 deaths were noted, most occurring\\nin India. Rabies is nowadays rare in the United\\nStates, as a result of good animal control practices.\\nOnset is delayed, usually weeks to months after the\\nperson has been bitten. Early symptoms of rabies\\ninclude fever, headache, and flu-like symptoms.\\nThese progress to anxiety, hallucinations , muscle\\nspasms,p a r t i a lparalysis, fear of water (hydropho-\\nbia), and other neurological symptoms as the virus\\nspreads to the central nervous system.

Tetanus immunization and general health\\nstatus are checked. An x ray may be ordered to assess\\nbone damage and to check forforeign objects in the\\nwound. Wound cultures are done for infected bites if\\nthe victim is at high risk for complications or if the\\ninfection does not respond to treatment. Evaluation of\\npossible exposure to rabies is also important. A biting\\nanimal suspected of having rabies is usually appre-\\nhended, tested, and observed for a period of time for\\nevidence of pre-existing infection.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment depends on the wound type, its site,\\nand risk factors for infection. All wounds are\\ncleaned and disinfected asthoroughly as possible.\\nBites to the head and face usually receive sutures, as\\ndo severe lacerations elsewhere. Puncture wounds\\nare left open. Ifabscess formation occurs, the phy-\\nsician may perform an incision so as to drain the\\nabscess.\\nIf infection occurs, antibiotics are prescribed.\\nAntibiotics may also be used for infection preven-\\ntion. Since a single bite wound may contain many\\ndifferent types of bacteria, no single antibiotic is\\nalways effective. Commonly prescribed antibiotics\\nare penicillin or a combination of amoxicillin and\\nclavulanate potassium. Aztreonam has been\\nreported to be effective in treating infections caused\\nby P. multocida .\\nBecause rabies is caused by a virus, antibiotics\\nare not effective. In addition, as of 2003, there is no\\nknown cure for the disease once symptoms become\\napparent. It is therefore recommended that indivi-\\nduals with a high risk of contracting the disease\\n(veterinarians, animal handlers, some laboratory\\nworkers) receive preexposurevaccination. Individuals\\nbitten by an unknown or potentially rapid animal\\nshould receive postexposure vaccination, also called\\npostexposureprophylaxis (PEP). The PEP regimen\\nconsists of one dose of vaccine given at the initial visit\\nas well as one dose of human immune globulin.\\nAdditional doses of vaccine are given on days 3, 7, 14,\\nand 28.\\nPrognosis\\nOnce a bacterial infection is halted, the bite victim\\nusually recovers fully. There is no known cure for\\nrabies once symptoms become evident and death is\\nalmost certain. WHO reports that 114 rabies deaths\\noccurred in the Americas in 1997, with only four\\ndeaths occurring that year in the United States, thus\\nemphasizing the importance of good animal control\\npractice and postexposure prophylaxis.\\nPrevention\\nPreventing bites obviously prevents subsequent\\ninfections. With regard to domestic pets, parents\\nshould inform themselves about the aggression level\\nand other characteristics of a particular breed before\\nbringing a purebred pet dog into the family, and\\nconsider having a specific dog evaluated by a veter-\\ninarian or animal behaviorist before adopting it. In\\naddition, parents should make sure that the dog has\\nbeen neutered or spayed, since intact dogs of either\\nsex are more likely to bite than those that have been\\naltered. Cat bites can oftenbe prevented by learning\\nabout a cat’s body language and recognizing the signs\\nof petting-induced aggression. These include dilating\\npupils, a low growl, stiffening of the body, twitching\\nof the tail, and flattening the ears backward against\\nthe head.\\nChildren under 12 years of age are at a higher risk\\nfor bites due to their small size and their inexperience\\nwith animals; therefore,they should be supervised\\nwith animals and taught to act appropriately around\\nthem. In particular, children should be taught not to\\ntease a dog by pulling its fur or tail; to leave a dog\\nalone while it is eating; and to avoid running or\\nscreaming in the presence of a dog, as the animal is\\nmore likely to chase a moving object. Direct eye con-\\ntact with a threatening dog should be avoided, as the\\ndog may interpret that as aggression. It is best to\\nstand still if at all possible, with feet together and\\narms against the chest; most dogs will lose interest\\nin an object that is not moving, and will eventually go\\naway.\\nA wild animal that is unusually aggressive or\\nbehaving strangely (e.g. a raccoon or bat that is active\\nduring the daytime or is physically uncoordinated)\\nshould be avoided and reported to the local animal\\ncontrol authorities; it may be infected with the rabies\\nvirus. Wild animals should not be taken in as pets, and\\ngarbage or pet food that might attract wild animals\\nshould not be left outside the home or camp site.\\nPeople should also avoid trying to break up fights\\nbetween animals and should as a rule approach\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 221\\nAnimal bite infections'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 251, 'page_label': '252'}, page_content='unknown cats and dogs very cautiously, especially on\\ntheir territory.

It has many sensory nerves and is sensitive to\\npain. The rectum is the last section of the digestive\\ntract and has a mucus layer as its inside surface. It\\nhas very few sensory nerves and is, therefore, relatively\\ninsensitive to pain. The anal canal has a ring of muscle,\\ncalled the anal sphincter, which keeps the anus closed.\\nThere are a number of different anorectal disorders.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAn anal fissure is a tear in the lining of the anus\\nthat is usually caused by a hard bowel movement.\\nFissures are painful and bleed when the tissue is\\nstressed during bowel movements.\\nAnorectal abscesses are characterized by pus-\\nforming infections in the anorectal region. Painful\\nabscesses form under the skin.\\nAn anorectal fistula is an abnormal opening or\\nchannel from the anorectal area to another part of\\nthe body. Typically, the channel leads to pockets of\\nskin near the anus. When seen in infants, anorectal\\nfistulas are consideredbirth defects. These are seen\\nmore frequently in boys than in girls. Fistulas are\\nalso seen more frequently in people who have other\\ndiseases, includingCrohn’s disease , tuberculosis,\\ncancer, and diverticulitis. Anorectal fistulas also\\noccur following anorectal abscesses or other injury\\nto the anal area. Fistulas are usually painful and\\ndischarge pus.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made by visual inspection of the skin\\naround the anus. Also, the doctor may probe the\\nrectum with a gloved finger. An anoscope is a short\\ninstrument that allows the physician to view the inside\\nof the anus. A proctoscope is a longer, rigid viewing\\ntube of approximately six to ten inches in length,\\nwhich may be used to look for anorectal disorders.\\nA sigmoidoscope is a longer, flexible tube, that\\nallows the physician to view up to about two feet of\\nthe inside of the large intestine.

The fourth edition of theDiagnostic and\\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders ,o r DSM-IV\\n(1994), defines two subtypes of anorexia nervosa–a\\nrestricting type, characterized by strict dieting and\\nexercisewithout binge eating; and a binge-eating/pur-\\nging type, marked by episodes of compulsive eating\\nwith or without self-inducedvomiting and the use of\\nlaxatives or enemas. DSM-IV defines a binge as a\\ntime-limited (usually under two hours) episode of\\ncompulsive eating in which the individual consumes\\na significantly larger amount of food than most people\\nwould eat in similar circumstances.\\nDescription\\nAnorexia nervosa was not officially classified as a\\npsychiatric disorder until the third edition ofDSM in\\n1980. It is, however, a growing problem among ado-\\nlescent females. Its incidence in the United States has\\ndoubled since 1970. The rise in the number of reported\\ncases reflects a genuine increase in the number of\\npersons affected by the disorder, and not simply earlier\\nor more accurate diagnosis. Estimates of the incidence\\nof anorexia range between 0.5–1% of caucasian female\\nadolescents. Over 90% of patients diagnosed with the\\ndisorder as of 1998 are female. It was originally thought\\nthat only 5% of anorexics are male, but that estimate is\\nbeing revised upward. The peak age range for onset of\\nthe disorder is 14-18 years, although there are patients\\nwho develop anorexia as late as their 40s. In the 1970s\\nand 1980s, anorexia was regarded as a disorder of\\nupper- and middle-class women, but that generalization\\nis also changing. More recent studies indicate that\\nanorexia is increasingly common among women of all\\nraces and social classes in the United States.\\nAnorexia nervosa is a serious public health\\nproblem not only because of its rising incidence, but\\nalso because it has one of the highest mortality rates\\nof any psychiatric disorder. Moreover, the disorder\\nmay cause serious long-term health complications,\\nincluding congestive heart failure , sudden death,\\ngrowth retardation, dental problems, constipation,\\nstomach rupture, swelling of the salivary glands, ane-\\nmia and other abnormalities of the blood, loss of\\nkidney function, andosteoporosis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnorexia is a disorder that results from the inter-\\naction of cultural and interpersonal as well as biologi-\\ncal factors. While the precise cause of the disease is not\\nknown, it has been linked to the following:\\nSocial influences\\nThe rising incidence of anorexia is thought to\\nreflect the present idealization of thinness as a badge\\nof upper-class status as well as of female beauty. In\\naddition, the increase in cases of anorexia includes\\n‘‘copycat’’ behavior, with some patients developing\\nthe disorder from imitating other girls.\\nThe onset of anorexia in adolescence is attributed\\nto a developmental crisis caused by girls’ changing\\nbodies coupled with society’s overemphasis on\\nwomen’s looks. The increasing influence of the mass\\nmedia in spreading and reinforcing gender stereotypes\\nhas also been noted.\\nOccupational goals\\nThe risk of developing anorexia is higher among\\nadolescents preparing for careers that require atten-\\ntion to weight and/or appearance. These high-risk\\ngroups include dancers, fashion models, professional\\nathletes (including gymnasts, skaters, long-distance\\nrunners, and jockeys), and actresses.\\nGenetic and biological influences\\nWomen whose biological mothers or sisters have\\nthe disorder appear to be at increased risk.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAmenorrhea— Absence of the menses in a female\\nwho has begun to have menstrual periods.\\nBinge eating— A pattern of eating marked by epi-\\nsodes of rapid consumption of large amounts of\\nfood; usually food that is high in calories.\\nBody dysmorphic disorder— A psychiatric disorder\\nmarked by preoccupation with an imagined physi-\\ncal defect.\\nHyperalimentation— A method of refeeding anor-\\nexics by infusing liquid nutrients and electrolytes\\ndirectly into central veins through a catheter.\\nLanugo— A soft, downy body hair that develops on\\nthe chest and arms of anorexic women.\\nPurging— The use of vomiting, diuretics, or laxatives\\nto clear the stomach and intestines after a binge.\\nRussell’s sign—Scraped or raw areas on the patient’s\\nknuckles, caused by self-induced vomiting.\\nSuperior mesenteric artery syndrome— A condi-\\ntion in which a person vomits after meals due to\\nblockage of the blood supply to the intestine.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 225\\nAnorexia nervosa'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 255, 'page_label': '256'}, page_content='Psychological factors\\nA number of theories have been advanced to\\nexplain the psychological aspects of the disorder. No\\nsingle explanation covers all cases. Anorexia nervosa\\nhas been interpreted as:\\n/C15A rejection of female sexual maturity. This rejection\\nis variously interpreted as a desire to remain a child,\\nor as a desire to resemble men as closely as possible.\\n/C15A reaction to sexualabuse or assault.\\n/C15A desire to appear as fragile and nonthreatening as\\npossible. This hypothesis reflects the idea that female\\npassivity and weakness are attractive to men.\\n/C15Overemphasis on control, autonomy, and indepen-\\ndence. Some anorexics come from achievement-\\noriented families that stress physical fitness and\\ndieting. Many anorexics are perfectionistic and\\n‘‘driven’’ about schoolwork and other matters in\\naddition to weight control.\\n/C15Evidence of family dysfunction. In some families, a\\ndaughter’s eating disorder serves as a distraction\\nfrom marital discord or other family tensions.\\n/C15Inability to interpret the body’s hunger signals accu-\\nrately due to early experiences of inappropriate\\nfeeding.\\nMale anorexics\\nAlthough anorexia nervosa is still considered a\\ndisorder that largely affects women, its incidence in\\nthe male population is rising. Less is known about the\\ncauses of anorexia in males, but some risk factors are\\nthe same as for females. These include certain occupa-\\ntional goals and increasing media emphasis on exter-\\nnal appearance in men. Moreover, homosexual males\\nare under pressure to conform to an ideal body weight\\nthat is about 20 pounds lighter than the standard\\n‘‘attractive’’ weight for heterosexual males.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of anorexia nervosa is complicated by a\\nnumber of factors. One is that the disorder varies\\nsomewhat in severity from patient to patient. A second\\nfactor is denial, which is regarded as an early sign of\\nthe disorder. Most anorexics deny that they are ill and\\nare usually brought to treatment by a family member.\\nMost anorexics are diagnosed by pediatricians or\\nfamily practitioners. Anorexics develop emaciated\\nbodies, dry or yellowish skin, and abnormally low\\nblood pressure. There is usually a history of amenor-\\nrhea (failure to menstruate) in females, and sometimes\\nof abdominal pain, constipation, or lack of energy.\\nThe patient may feel chilly or have developed lanugo,\\na growth of downy body hair. If the patient has been\\nvomiting, she may have eroded tooth enamel or\\nRussell’s sign (scars on the back of the hand). The\\nsecond step in diagnosis is measurement of the\\npatient’s weight loss.DSM-IV specifies a weight loss\\nleading to a body weight 15% below normal, with\\nsome allowance for body build and weight history.\\nThe doctor will need to rule out other physical\\nconditions that can cause weight loss or vomiting\\nafter eating, including metabolic disorders, brain\\ntumors (especially hypothalamus and pituitary gland\\nlesions), diseases of the digestive tract, and a condition\\ncalled superior mesenteric artery syndrome. Persons\\nwith this condition sometimes vomit after meals\\nbecause the blood supply to the intestine is blocked.\\nThe doctor will usually order blood tests, an electro-\\ncardiogram,urinalysis, and bone densitometry (bone\\ndensity test) in order to exclude other diseases and to\\nassess the patient’s nutritional status.\\nThe doctor will also need to distinguish between\\nanorexia and other psychiatric disorders, including\\ndepression, schizophrenia, social phobia, obsessive-\\ncompulsive disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder.\\nTwo diagnostic tests that are often used are the\\nEating Attitudes Test (EAT) and the Eating Disorder\\nInventory (EDI).\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of anorexia nervosa includes both\\nshort- and long-term measures, and requires assessment\\nby dietitians and psychiatrists as well as medical specia-\\nlists. Therapy is often complicated by the patient’s\\nresistance or failure to carry out treatment plan.\\nHospital treatment\\nHospitalization is recommended for anorexics\\nwith any of the following characteristics:\\n/C15weight of 40% or more below normal; or weight loss\\nover a three-month period of more than 30 pounds\\n/C15severely disturbed metabolism\\n/C15severe binging and purging\\n/C15signs ofpsychosis\\n/C15severe depression or risk ofsuicide\\n/C15family in crisis\\nHospital treatment includes individual andgroup\\ntherapy as well as refeeding and monitoring of the\\npatient’s physical condition.

Kapes\\nAnosmia\\nDefinition\\nThe term anosmia means lack of the sense of\\nsmell. It may also refer to a decreased sense of smell.\\nAgeusia, a companion word, refers to a lack of taste\\nsensation. Patients who actually have anosmia may\\ncomplain wrongly of ageusia, although they retain\\nthe ability to distinguish salt, sweet, sour, and bitter–\\nhumans’ only taste sensations.\\nDescription\\nOf the five senses, smell ranks fourth in importance\\nfor humans, although it is much more pronounced in\\nother animals. Bloodhounds, for example, can smell an\\nodor a thousand times weaker than humans. Taste,\\nconsidered the fifth sense, is mostly the smell of food\\nin the mouth. The sense of smell originates from the\\nfirst cranial nerves (the olfactory nerves), which sit at\\nthe base of the brain’s frontal lobes, right behind the\\neyes and above the nose. Inhaled airborne chemicals\\nstimulate these nerves.\\nThere are other aberrations of smell beside a\\ndecrease. Smells can be distorted, intensified, or hallu-\\ncinated. These changes usually indicate a malfunction\\nof the brain.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of anosmia is nasal\\nocclusion caused by rhinitis (inflammation of the\\nKEY TERMS\\nAnal fissure— An ulcer on the margin of the anus.\\nDigital rectal examination— An examination\\nwhere a gloved, lubricated index finger is inserted\\ninto the rectum to check for any abnormalities.\\nPolyps— A tumor with a small flap that attaches\\nitself to the wall of various vascular organs such as\\nthe nose, uterus and rectum.

If no air gets to the olfactory\\nnerves, smell will not happen. In turn, rhinitis and\\nnasal polyps(growths on nasal membranes) are caused\\nby irritants such as allergens, infections, cigarette\\nsmoke, and other air pollutants. Tumors such as\\nnasal polyps can also block the nasal passages and\\nthe olfactory nerves and cause anosmia.Head injury\\nor, rarely, certain viral infections can damage or\\ndestroy the olfactory nerves.\\nDiagnosis\\nIt is difficult to measure a loss of smell, and no one\\ncomplains of loss of smell in just one nostril. So a\\nphysician usually begins by testing each nostril sepa-\\nrately with a common, non-irritating odor such as\\nperfume, lemon, vanilla, or coffee. Polyps and rhinitis\\nare obvious causal agents a physician looks for.\\nImaging studies of the head may be necessary in\\norder to detect brain injury, sinus infection, or tumor.\\nTreatment\\nCessation ofsmoking is the first step. Many smo-\\nkers who quit discover new tastes so enthusiastically\\nthat they immediately gain weight. Attention to redu-\\ncing exposure to other nasal irritants and treatment of\\nrespiratory allergies or chronic upper respiratory\\ninfections will be beneficial.Corticosteroids are parti-\\ncularly helpful.\\nAlternative treatment\\nFinding and treating the cause of the loss of smell\\nis the first approach innaturopathic medicine. If rhini-\\ntis is the cause, treating acute rhinitis with herbal mast\\ncell stabilizers and herbaldecongestants can offer some\\nrelief as the body heals. If chronic rhinitis is present,\\nthis is often related to an environmental irritant or to\\nfood allergies. Removal of the causative factors is the\\nfirst step to healing. Nasal steams with essential oils\\noffer relief of the blockage and tonification of the\\nmembranes. Blockages can sometimes be resolved\\nthrough naso-specific therapy–a way of realigning\\nthe nasal cavities. Polyp blockage can be addressed\\nthrough botanical medicine treatment as well as\\nhydrotherapy. Olfactory nerve damage may not be\\nregenerable. Some olfactory aberrations, like intensi-\\nfied sense of smell, can be resolved usinghomeopathic\\nmedicine.\\nPrognosis\\nIf nasal inflammation is the cause of anosmia, the\\nchances of recovery are excellent. However, if nerve\\ndamage is the cause of the problem, the recovery of\\nsmell is much more difficult.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFauci, Anthony S., et al., editors.Harrison’s Principles of\\nInternal Medicine.

If the condition does not involve\\ntotal oxygen deprivation, it is often called hypoxia,\\nalthough the two terms have been used interchange-\\nably. A related condition, anoxemia, occurs when the\\nblood circulates but contains a below normal amount\\nof oxygen.\\nThe five types of anoxia or hypoxia include\\nhypoxemic, anemic, affinity, stagnant, and histotoxic.\\nHypoxemic anoxia happens when the oxygen pressure\\noutside the body is so low that the hemoglobin, the\\nchemical which carries oxygen in the red blood cells\\n(RBCs), is unable to become fully loaded with the gas.\\nThis results in too little oxygen reaching the tissues\\nand can occur in suffocation when a person is at high\\nKEY TERMS\\nAllergen— Any substance that irritates only those\\nwho are sensitive (allergic) to it.\\nCorticosteroids— Cortisone, prednisone, and\\nrelated drugs that reduce inflammation.\\nRhinitis— Inflammation and swelling of the nasal\\nmembranes.\\nNasal polyps— Drop-shaped overgrowths of the\\nnasal membranes.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 229\\nAnoxia'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 259, 'page_label': '260'}, page_content='altitude, where the pressure of oxygen in the air is\\nmuch less than at sea level.\\nAnemic anoxia results from a decrease in the\\namount of hemoglobin or RBCs in the blood, which\\nreduces the ability to get oxygen to the tissues. Anemia\\nmay result from lack of production of red blood cells\\n(iron deficiency), blood loss (hemorrhage), or shor-\\ntened lifespan of red blood cells (autoimmune disease).\\nAffinity anoxia involves a defect in the chemistry\\nof the blood such that the hemoglobin can no longer\\npick up as much oxygen from the air, even though the\\nquantities are normal, reducing how much is delivered\\nto the tissues.\\nStagnant anoxia occurs when there is interference\\nwith the blood flow, although the blood and its\\noxygen-carrying abilities are normal. A common\\ncause of general stagnant anoxia is heart disease or\\ninterference with the return of blood flow through the\\nveins. Examples of local stagnant anoxia include expo-\\nsure to cold, diseases that restrict circulation to the\\nextremities, and ergotpoisoning. When the tissue or\\norgan itself has a reduced ability to accept and use the\\noxygen, it is called histotoxic anoxia. The classic exam-\\nple is cyanide poisoning, where the chemical inacti-\\nvates a cellular enzyme necessary for the cell to use\\noxygen. Thus, tissue exposed to cyanide cannot use the\\noxygen even though it is in normal amounts in the\\nbloodstream. Histotoxic anoxia can also be caused\\nby exposure tonarcotics, alcohol, formaldehyde, acet-\\none, toluene, and certain anesthetic agents.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnoxia and hypoxia can be caused by any number\\nofdiseasestatesoftheblood,lungs,heartandcirculation\\nincludingheart attack,s e v e r easthma,o r emphysema.\\nIt can also result from smoke or carbon monoxide inha-\\nlation, improper exposure to anesthesia, poisoning,\\nstrangulation,near-drowning, or high altitude exposure\\nthrough mountain climbing or travel in an insufficiently\\npressurized airplane. Anoxia, and the resultant brain\\ndamage, is a particular problem with newborns during\\ndifficult births.\\nNo matter what the cause of anoxia, the symp-\\ntoms are similar. In severe cases, the patient is often\\nconfused and commonly stuperous or comatose (in a\\nstate of unconsciousness). Depending on the severity\\nof the injury to the brain, the organ most sensitive to\\nreduced oxygen intake, this condition can persist for\\nhours, days, weeks, or even months or years. Seizures,\\nmyoclonic jerks (involuntarymuscle spasms or\\ntwitches), and neck stiffness are some other symptoms\\nof the anoxic condition.\\nSymptoms of more localized or less complete oxy-\\ngen deprivation (hypoxia) include increased breathing\\nrate, lightheadedness,dizziness, tingling or warm sen-\\nsation, sweating, reduced field of vision, sleepiness, a\\nbluish tint to skin, particularly the fingertips and lips,\\nand behavior changes, often an inappropriate sense of\\neuphoria.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of anoxia and hypoxia is commonly\\nmade through the appearance of clinical symptoms.\\nHowever, suspected reduction in oxygen reaching the\\ntissues can be confirmed using laboratory tests. The\\nexact test that is performed is dependent on the sus-\\npected cause of the anoxia. One systemic measure of\\ntissue anoxia is the serum lactate (lactic acid) test.\\nWhen cells are forced to produce energy without oxy-\\ngen, as would happen during anoxia, lactic acid is one\\nof the byproducts. Thus, an increase in lactic acid in\\nthe blood would indicate that tissues were starved for\\noxygen and are using non-oxygen pathways to pro-\\nduce energy. Normally, the blood contains less than\\n2mmol/L of lactic acid. However, some forms of\\nanoxia do not increase lactic acid concentrations in\\nthe blood and some increases in lactic acid levels are\\nnot associated with anoxia, so an elevated value for\\nthis test is only suggestive of an anoxic or hypoxic\\ncondition.\\nTreatment\\nThe exact treatment for anoxia is dependent on\\nthe cause of the reduced oxygen reaching the tissues.\\nHowever, immediate restoration of tissue oxygen\\nlevels through supplementing the patient’s air supply\\nwith 100% oxygen is a common first step. Secondary\\nsteps often include support of the cardiovascular sys-\\ntem through drugs or other treatment, treatment of\\nKEY TERMS\\nAmnesia— Loss of memory often traceable to brain\\ntissue damage.\\nAnoxemia— An extreme lack of oxygen in the blood.\\nHemoglobin— A chemical found in red blood cells\\nthat transports oxygen.\\nMyoclonus— Involuntary contractions of a muscle\\nor group of muscles.\\n230 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAnoxia'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 260, 'page_label': '261'}, page_content='lung disease, transfusions, or administration of anec-\\ndotes for poisoning, as appropriate.\\nPrognosis\\nA good prognosis is dependent on the ability to\\ntreat the underlying cause of the low oxygen levels.

Additional\\ncomponents of some formulations include dimethi-\\ncone, to reduce gas pains (flatulence) and alginic\\nacid, which, in combination with antacids, may help\\nmanage GERD (gastro-esophageal reflux disease).\\nAntacids should not be confused with gastric acid\\ninhibitors, such as the H-2 receptor blockers (cimeti-\\ndine, ranitide and others) or theproton pump inhibitors\\n(lansoprazole, omeprazole and others). Although all\\nthree classes of drugs act to reduce the levels of gastric\\nacid, their mechanisms are different, and this affects\\nthe appropriate use of the drug. Antacids have a rapid\\nonset and short duration of action, and are most\\nappropriate for rapid relief of gastric discomfort for\\na short period of time.\\nAntacids may be divided into two classes, those\\nthat work by chemical neutralization of gastric acid,\\nmost notably sodium bicarbonate; and those that act\\nby adsorption of the acid (non-absorbable antacids),\\nsuch as calcium and magnesium salts.\\nThe chemical antacids show the most rapid onset\\nof action, but may cause ‘‘acid rebound,’’ a condition\\nin which the gastric acid returns in greater concentra-\\ntion after the drug effect has stopped. Also, since\\nthese antacids may contain high concentrations of\\nsodium, they may be inappropriate in patients with\\nhypertension.\\nCalcium and magnesium salts act by adsorption\\nof the acid, and are less prone to the rebound effect,\\nbut may have other significant disadvantages. These\\nantacids are particularly prone todrug interactions,\\nand patients taking other medications must often\\navoid simultaneous administration of the medica-\\ntions. These antacids are more effective in liquid for-\\nmulations than in tablet or capsule form, and so may\\nbe inconvenient for routine dosing.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 231\\nAntacids'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 261, 'page_label': '262'}, page_content='The non-absorbable antacids may have additional\\nuses beyond control of hyperacidity.

Physicians order an ultrasound scan to listen\\nfor a fetal heartbeat, determine a woman’s precise due\\ndate and check for twins, among other uses. An ultra-\\nsound scan also is known as a sonogram. The proce-\\ndure takes a few minutes, is painless and usually is\\ncovered by health insurance.\\nThe ultrasound technician will ask the pregnant\\nwoman to remove her clothes and change into a gown.\\nThe technician may rub some gel on the woman’s stom-\\nach, which helps the hand-held device pick up sound\\nwaves better. In certain cases, the technician may insert\\na plastic probe into the woman’s vaginal canal to get a\\nclearer picture of the fetus.

It does not cause any known side-effects\\nthat would harm the mother or baby.\\nPregnant women usually will have their first ultra-\\nsound anytime between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation. In\\nnormal cases, the technician is able to identify a fetal\\nheartbeat, which appears as a flashing light on the\\nscreen. Closer to the due date, physicians use ultra-\\nsound to make sure the fetus is in the correct position\\nto exit the birth canal head first.\\nSometimes an ultrasound will show that a fetus\\nhas stopped growing, or a gestational sac has formed\\nwithout a fetus, and a miscarriage has occurred. Later\\nin pregnancy, it also may show that the child is in a\\nbreech position, oriented feet first, which can cause a\\ndifficult labor.\\nTests for birth defects\\nMost obstetricians offer parents a variety of ways\\nto find out if their developing child might havebirth\\ndefects such asspina bifida and Down Syndrome.A n\\nalpha fetoprotein screen can be done through a simple\\nblood test in the doctor’s office between the 16th and\\n18th week of gestation. It tells the odds that their child\\nwill have a severe congenital anomaly. The test works\\nby measuring the level of alpha fetoprotein, a sub-\\nstance produced by a fetus with birth defects. Low\\nlevels of alpha fetoprotein in the mother’s blood may\\nindicate Down’s Syndrome. In that case, the next step\\nfor most couples isamniocentesis because the alpha\\nfetoprotein test can give false-positive results.\\nAmniocentesis is a more accurate test, but it also has\\nhigher risks of complications.\\nThis procedure typically is used to diagnose Down\\nsyndrome while a developing child is still in the womb,\\nat 15-28 weeks.\\nDuring amniocentesis, a doctor inserts a needle\\nthrough a woman’s vaginal canal and inside her cer-\\nvix. Using ultrasound as a guide, the doctor pierces the\\nuterus to withdraw a sample of fluid from the amniotic\\nsac. Afterwards, tiny cells shed by the fetus can be\\nstudied in the laboratory. Scientists can analyze\\nDNA samples to determine if the fetus has Down\\nsyndrome or other genetic conditions. Amniocentesis\\nalso can determine the sex of the fetus.\\nWomen who have a history of recurring miscar-\\nriages may not want to have this procedure.\\nAmniocentesis is usually performed in a doctor’s\\noffice on an outpatient basis.\\nCommon side effects include cramping and\\nbleeding.\\nIn about one out of every 1,000 cases, amniocen-\\ntesis causes a needle to puncture the uterine wall,\\nwhich could result in miscarriage.\\nIn most cases, couples find out their baby does not\\nhave a birth defect.\\nIf the results come back positive for Down’s\\nSyndrome or other serious conditions, the couple\\nmust decide if they want to end the pregnancy.\\nOthers use the knowledge to plan and prepare any\\nspecial care needed for their future child.\\nGroup B Strep\\nThis test is for Group B streptococci (GBS)\\ninfection.\\nBy testing for GBS, physicians can determine if\\na woman is at risk of passing this infection along to\\nher child.\\nWomen who have had a prior child with GBS, or\\nwho have afever or prolonged or premature rupture of\\nthe amniotic sac may be at higher risk for this type of\\ninfection.\\nGBS is a type of bacteria commonly found in the\\nvagina and rectum. Unlike regularstrep throat, GBS\\ncan be present in a person’s body without causing any\\nsymptoms, so many women do not realize they are\\ninfected with it.\\nTo test for the presence of GBS, doctors may take\\na urine sample. They also may collect samples from the\\nvagina or rectum, which are then analyzed in a lab.\\nThis test is usually performed late in pregnancy, at\\n35-37 weeks of gestation.\\nThis is a routine urine test or pelvic exam with no\\nside effects.\\nIn many cases, doctors do not find any evidence of\\nthis type of infection.\\nIf a woman is found to be infected with Group B\\nstrep, physicians usually wait to treat it until just\\nbefore labor begins. At that time, they may give the\\nmotherantibiotics so the baby is not born with the\\ninfection. Newborns who are exposed to Group B\\nstrep can have inflammation of the brain, spinal\\ncord, blood or lungs.

Antepartum tests include the nonstress test\\n(NST), biophysical profile, and contractionstress\\ntest (CST).\\nPurpose\\nAntepartum testing is performed after 32 weeks of\\npregnancy so that the couple and the doctor can be\\nwarned of any problems that may necessitate further\\ntesting or immediate delivery. The results reflect the\\nadequacy of blood flow (and oxygen delivery) to the\\nfetus from the placenta.\\nAntepartum tests are usually done in pregnancies\\nat high risk for fetal complications. Various reasons\\ninclude:\\n/C15any chronic illness in the mother, such as high blood\\npressure or diabetes\\n/C15problems with previous pregnancies, such as\\nstillbirth\\n/C15fetal complications, such asintrauterine growth retar-\\ndation (a slowing of growth of the fetus) orbirth\\ndefects\\n/C15problems in the current pregnancy, includingpree-\\nclampsia (serious pregnancy-induced high blood\\npressure), gestational (pregnancy-related) diabetes,\\npremature rupture of the membranes, excessive\\namniotic fluid (the liquid that surrounds the fetus),\\nvaginal bleeding, orplacenta previa (a condition in\\nwhich the placenta is positioned over the cervix\\ninstead of near the top of the uterus)\\n/C15twins or other multiple fetuses\\nOne of the most common indications for antepar-\\ntum testing is post-term pregnancy. A pregnancy\\nshould not be allowed to continue past 42 weeks.\\n(The usual pregnancy is 40 weeks in duration).\\nBabies should be monitored with antepartum testing\\nstarting at 41 weeks. After 41 weeks, there is an\\nincreasing risk that the placenta cannot meet the grow-\\ning baby’s needs for oxygen andnutrition. This may be\\nreflected in decreased movements of the baby,\\ndecreased amniotic fluid, and changes in the heart\\nrate pattern of the baby.\\nDescription\\nTechnology\\nThe NST and CST use a technique calledelectro-\\nnic fetal monitoringto evaluate the heartbeat of the\\nfetus. The biophysical profile is an ultrasound\\nexamination.\\nNST\\nThe NST is usually the first antepartum test used to\\nverify fetal well-being. It is based on the principle that\\nwhen the fetus moves, its heartbeat normally speeds up.\\nThe NST assesses fetal health through monitoring\\naccelerations of the heart rate in response to the\\nbaby’s own movements, i.e., in the absence ofstress.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAmniotic fluid— The liquid that surrounds the baby\\nwithin the amniotic sac. Because it is composed\\nmostly of fetal urine, a low amount of fluid can indi-\\ncate inadequate placental blood flow to the fetus.\\nDeceleration— A decrease in the fetal heart rate\\nthat can indicate inadequate blood flow through\\nthe placenta.\\nOxytocin— A natural hormone that produces uter-\\nine contractions.\\nUltrasound— A procedure in which high-\\nfrequency sound waves are used to create a picture\\nof the baby, used alone or with antepartum tests.\\nVibroacoustic stimulation— In the biophysical pro-\\nfile, use of an artificial larynx to produce a loud\\nnoise to ‘‘awaken’’ the fetus.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 235\\nAntepartum testing'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 265, 'page_label': '266'}, page_content='The mother lays down or sits, and an electronic\\nfetal monitor is placed on her abdomen to monitor the\\nfetal heart rate. The doctor records the baby’s heart-\\nbeat on a graph or ‘‘tracing’’ to determine whether it\\ndemonstrates correct reactivity, or acceleration of the\\nheart rate. To record fetal movements on the tracing,\\nthe mother presses a button every time she feels the\\nbaby move. If the baby is inactive, the mother may be\\nasked to rub her abdomen to ‘‘awaken’’ it. Sometimes\\nan instrument is used to produce a loud noise to arouse\\nthe fetus (vibroacoustic stimulation). The test usually\\ntakes between 20–45 minutes.\\nA baby who is receiving enough oxygen should\\nmove at least twice in a 20 minute period. The baby’s\\nheart rate should increase at least 20 beats per minute\\nfor at least 20 seconds during these movements. The\\nNST is the simplest and cheapest antepartum test.\\nBiophysical profile\\nThe biophysical profile is an ultrasound exam that\\ncan add additional information to the NST. During\\nthe biophysical profile, the examiner checks for var-\\nious characteristics of the baby to evaluate its overall\\nhealth. These include: fetal movement, fetal tone,\\nbreathing movements, and the amniotic fluid volume.\\nAmniotic fluid volume is important because a\\ndecreased amount raises the possibility that the baby\\nmay be under stress. The five components of the test\\n(NST is also included) are each given a score of 2 for\\nnormal (or present), 1 if decreased, and 0 for abnor-\\nmal. The highest possible score is 10. The ‘‘modified’’\\nbiophysical profile is another option; this includes\\nonly the NST and amniotic fluid volume.\\nCST\\nThe CST is like the NST, except that the fetus is\\nevaluated in response to contractions of the mother’s\\nuterus. Because it is a more complicated test, it is often\\nused after an abnormal NST to confirm the results.\\nUterine contractions produce ‘‘stress’’ in the fetus\\nbecause they temporarily stop the flow of blood and\\noxygen. The CST is used to confirm that the fetus does\\nnot respond to this stress by a decrease in the heart rate.\\nThe CST is performed with the same equipment as\\nthe NST. Maternal blood pressure and fetal heart rate\\nare recorded along with the onset, relative intensity,\\nand duration of any spontaneous contractions. For an\\naccurate test, the contractions should be of sufficient\\nduration and frequency. If uterine activity does not\\noccur naturally, a drug called oxytocin may be given to\\nthe mother intravenously (hence the test’s alternate\\nname, the oxytocin challenge test) to provoke\\ncontractions. Another option is self-stimulation of\\nthe mother’s nipples, because this releases natural\\noxytocin. The fetal heart rate is observed until, ideally,\\nthree moderate contractions occur within 10 minutes.\\nPreparation\\nThe mother should eat just before the antepartum\\ntests to help stimulate fetal activity.\\nRisks\\nThere are no appreciable risks from the NST or\\nthe biophysical profile. Ultrasound used for the bio-\\nphysical profile is painless and safe because it uses no\\nharmful radiation, and no evidence has been found\\nthat sound waves cause any adverse effects on the\\nmother or fetus.\\nThe frequency of antepartum testing depends on\\nthe reason for its use. All of the tests occasionally give\\nincorrect results, which may prompt an unnecessary\\nearly delivery or cesarean. Repeat testing is important\\nto double-check any abnormal findings.\\nNormal results\\nIn general, ‘‘negative’’ or normal results on ante-\\npartum testing provide reassurance that the baby is\\nhealthy and should remain so for perhaps a week, with\\nno need for immediate delivery. Unfortunately, the\\ntests cannot guarantee that there are no problems,\\nbecause falsely normal results can occur, though this\\nis unusual. Even if all test results are normal, it is\\nimportant to realize that this does not guarantee a\\n‘‘perfect’’ baby.\\nThe NST is normal (‘‘reactive’’) if two or more\\ndistinct fetal movements occur in association with\\nappropriate accelerations of the fetal heart rate within\\n20 minutes. A biophysical profile score of 8-10 is con-\\nsidered reassuring. The CST is normal if the fetus\\nshows no decelerations in heart rate in response to\\nthree uterine contractions within 10 minutes.\\nAbnormal results\\nA ‘‘positive’’ result suggests that the baby is not\\nreceiving enough oxygen for some reason. However, it\\nis quite possible that the test result was falsely abnor-\\nmal. To confirm or monitor a suspected disorder,\\nfollow-up testing with the same or an alternate test\\nwill probably be performed at least weekly.\\nThe NST is abnormal (‘‘nonreactive’’) if the fetal\\nheart rate fails to speed up by at least 20 beats per\\n236 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAntepartum testing'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 266, 'page_label': '267'}, page_content='minute at least two times during a 20-minute period.\\nAbnormal decreases in the heart rate (decelerations)\\nare also a cause for concern.\\nA biophysical profile score of 6 is considered a\\ncause for concern and should be followed by further\\ntesting.

In humans, the\\ninfection can often be treated, but it is almost always\\nfatal in animals.\\nDescription\\nAnthrax is most often found in the agricultural\\nareas of South and Central America, southern and\\neastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the\\nMiddle East. In the United States, anthrax is rarely\\nreported; however, cases of animal infection with\\nanthrax are most often reported in Texas, Louisiana,\\nMississippi, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. The bac-\\nterium and its associated disease get their name from\\nthe Greek word meaning ‘‘coal’’ because of the char-\\nacteristic coal-black sore that is the hallmark of the\\nmost common form of the disease.\\nDuring the 1800s, in England and Germany,\\nanthrax was known either as ‘‘wool-sorter’s’’ or ‘‘rag-\\npicker’s’’ disease because workers contracted the dis-\\nease from bacterial spores present on hides and in\\nwool or fabric fibers. Spores are the small, thick-\\nwalled dormant stage of some bacteria that enable\\nthem to survive for long periods of time under adverse\\nconditions. The first anthrax vaccine was perfected in\\n1881 by Louis Pasteur.\\nThe largest outbreak ever recorded in the United\\nStates occurred in 1957 when nine employees of a goat\\nhair processing plant became ill after handling a con-\\ntaminated shipment from Pakistan. Four of the five\\npatients with the pulmonary form of the disease died.\\nOther cases appeared in the 1970s when contaminated\\ngoatskin drumheads from Haiti were brought into the\\nU.S. as souvenirs.\\nHumans suffering from anthrax often develop ulcerating\\nnodules on the body.

However,\\nsome serious epidemics continue to occur among ani-\\nmal herds and in human settlements in developing\\ncountries due to ineffective control programs. In\\nhumans, the disease is almost always an occupational\\nhazard, contracted by those who handle animal hides\\n(farmers, butchers, and veterinarians) or sort wool.\\nThere are no reports of the disease spreading from\\none person to another.\\nAnthrax as a weapon\\nThere has been a great deal of recent concern\\nthat the bacteria that cause anthrax may be used as\\na type of biological warfare, since it is possible to\\nbecome infected simply by inhaling the spores, and\\ninhaled anthrax is the most serious form of the\\ndisease. The bacteria can be grown in laboratories,\\nand with a great deal of expertise and special equip-\\nment, the bacteria can be altered to be usable as a\\nweapon.\\nThe largest-ever documented outbreak of human\\nanthrax contracted through spore inhalation occurred\\nin Russia in 1979, when anthrax spores were acciden-\\ntally released from a military laboratory, causing a\\nregional epidemic that killed 69 of its 77 victims. In\\nthe United States in 2001, terrorists converted anthrax\\nspores into a powder that could be inhaled and mailed\\nit to intended targets, including news agencies and\\nprominent individuals in the federal government.\\nBecause the United States government considers\\nanthrax to be of potential risk to soldiers, the\\nDepartment of Defense has begun systematic vaccina-\\ntion of all military personnel against anthrax.\\nFor civilians in the United States, the government\\nhas instituted a program called the National\\nPharmaceutical Stockpile program in whichantibio-\\ntics and other medical materials to treat two million\\npeople are located so that they could be received any-\\nwhere in the country within twelve hours following a\\ndisaster or terrorist attack.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe naturally occurring bacterium Bacillus\\nanthracis produces spores that can remain dormant\\nfor years in soil and on animal products, such as\\nhides, wool, hair, or bones. The disease is often fatal\\nto cattle, sheep, and goats, and their hides, wool, and\\nbones are often heavily contaminated.\\nThe bacteria are found in many types of soil, all\\nover the world, and usually do not pose a problem for\\nhumans because the spores stay in the ground. In\\norder to infect a human, the spores have to be released\\nfrom the soil and must enter the body. They can enter\\nthe body through a cut in the skin, through consuming\\ncontaminated meat, or through inhaling the spores.\\nOnce the spores are in the body, and if antibiotics are\\nnot administered, the spores become bacteria that\\nmultiply and release a toxin that affects the immune\\nsystem. In the inhaled form of the infection, the\\nimmune system can become overwhelmed and the\\nbody can go intoshock.\\nSymptoms vary depending on how the disease was\\ncontracted, but the symptoms usually appear within\\none week of exposure.\\nCutaneous anthrax\\nIn humans, anthrax usually occurs when the\\nspores enter a cut or abrasion, causing a skin (cuta-\\nneous) infection at the site. Cutaneous anthrax, as this\\ninfection is called, is the mildest and most common\\nform of the disease. At first, the bacteria cause an\\nitchy, raised area like an insect bite. Within one to\\ntwo days, inflammation occurs around the raised\\narea, and a blister forms around an area of dying tissue\\nthat becomes black in the center. Other symptoms may\\ninclude shivering and chills. In most cases, the bacteria\\nKEY TERMS\\nAntibody— A specific protein produced by the\\nimmune system in response to a specific foreign\\nprotein or particle called an antigen.\\nAntitoxin— An antibody that neutralizes a toxin.\\nBronchitis— Inflammation of the mucous mem-\\nbrane of the bronchial tubes of the lung that can\\nmake it difficult to breathe.\\nCutaneous— Pertaining to the skin\\nMeningitis— Inflammation of the membranes cov-\\nering the brain and spinal cord called the\\nmeninges.\\nPulmonary— Having to do with the lungs or\\nrespiratory system.\\nSpore— A dormant form assumed by some bac-\\nteria, such as anthrax, that enable the bacterium\\nto survive high temperatures, dryness, and lack of\\nnourishment for long periods of time.

If, however, they spread to the\\nnearest lymph node (or, in rare cases, escape into the\\nbloodstream), the bacteria can cause a form of blood\\npoisoningthat rapidly proves fatal.\\nInhalation anthrax\\nInhaling the bacterial spores can lead to a rare,\\noften-fatal form of anthrax known as pulmonary or\\ninhalation anthrax that attacks the lungs and sometimes\\nspreads to the brain. Inhalation anthrax begins with flu-\\nlike symptoms, namelyfever, fatigue, headache,m u s c l e\\naches, andshortness of breath. As early as one day after\\nthese initial symptoms appear, and as long as two weeks\\nlater, the symptoms suddenly worsen and progress to\\nbronchitis. The patient experiences difficulty breath-\\ning, and finally, the patient enters a state of shock.\\nThis rare form of anthrax is often fatal, even if treated\\nwithin one or two days after the symptoms appear.\\nIntestinal anthrax\\nIntestinal anthrax is a rare, often-fatal form of the\\ndisease, caused by eating meat from an animal that\\ndied of anthrax. Intestinal anthrax causes stomach\\nand intestinal inflammation and sores or lesions\\n(ulcers), much like the sores that appear on the skin\\nin the cutaneous form of anthrax. The first signs of the\\ndisease arenausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, and\\nfever, followed by abdominalpain, vomiting of blood,\\nand severe bloodydiarrhea.\\nDiagnosis\\nAnthrax is diagnosed by detectingB. anthracis in\\nsamples taken from blood, spinal fluid,skin lesions,o r\\nrespiratory secretions. The bacteria may be positively\\nidentified using biochemical methods or using a tech-\\nnique whereby, if present in the sample, the anthrax\\nbacterium is made to fluoresce. Blood samples will\\nalso indicate elevated antibody levels or increased\\namounts of a protein produced directly in response\\nto infection with the anthrax bacterium. Polymerase\\nchain reaction (PCR) tests amplify trace amounts of\\nDNA to show that the anthrax bacteria are present.\\nAdditional DNA-based tests are also currently being\\nperfected.\\nTreatment\\nIn the early stages, anthrax is curable by adminis-\\ntering high doses of antibiotics, but in the advanced\\nstages, it can be fatal. If anthrax is suspected, health\\ncare professionals may begin to treat the patient with\\nantibiotics even before the diagnosis is confirmed\\nbecause early intervention is essential. The antibiotics\\nused include penicillin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxa-\\ncin. Because inhaled spores can remain in the body for\\na long time, antibiotic treatment for inhalation\\nanthrax should continue for 60 days. In the case of\\ncutaneous anthrax, the infection may be cured follow-\\ning a single dose of antibiotic, but it is important to\\ncontinue treatment so as to avoid potential serious\\ncomplications, such as inflammation of the mem-\\nbranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).\\nIn the setting of potential bioterrorism, cutaneous\\nanthrax should be treated with a 60-day dose of\\nantibiotics.\\nResearch is ongoing to develop new antibiotics\\nand antitoxins that would work against the anthrax\\nbacteria and the toxins they produce. One Harvard\\nprofessor, Dr. R. John Collier, and his team have been\\ntesting two possible antitoxins on rats. A Stanford\\nmicrobiologist and a Penn State chemist have also\\nbeen testing their new antibiotic against the bacteria\\nthat causebrucellosis and tularemia, as well as\\nthe bacteria that cause anthrax. All of these drugs\\nare still in early investigational stages, however, and\\nit is still unknown how these drugs would affect\\nhumans.\\nPrognosis\\nUntreated anthrax is often fatal, butdeath is far\\nless likely with appropriate care.

Frey, PhD\\nAntiandrogen drugs\\nDefinition\\nAntiandrogen drugs are a diverse group of medi-\\ncations given to counteract the effects of androgens\\n(male sex hormones) on various body organs and\\ntissues. Some medications in this category work by\\nlowering the body’s production of androgens while\\nothers work by blocking the body’s ability to make\\nuse of the androgens that are produced. The first\\ngroup of antiandrogens includes such medications as\\nleuprolide (Lupron, Viadur, or Eligard), goserelin\\n(Zoladex), triptorelin (Trelstar Depot), and abarelix\\n(Plenaxis). The second group includes flutamide\\n(Eulexin), nilutamide (Nilandron), cyproterone acet-\\nate (Cyprostat, Androcur, Cyproterone), and bicalu-\\ntamide (Casodex). Flutamide, nilutamide, and\\nbicalutamide are nonsteroidal antiandrogen drugs\\nwhile cyproterone acetate is a steroidal medication.\\nSome drugs that were originally developed to treat\\nother conditions are sometimes categorized as antian-\\ndrogens because their off-label uses include some of\\nthe disorders listed below.

It is sometimes called\\npattern baldness.\\n/C15Acne. Acne is the end result of several factors, one of\\nwhich is excessive production of sebum, a whitish\\nsemiliquid greasy substance produced by certain\\nglands in the skin. Antiandrogens may help to clear\\nacne by slowing down the secretion of sebum, which\\ndepends on androgen production.\\n/C15Amenorrhea. Amenorrhea, or the absence of men-\\nstrual periods in females of childbearing age, is some-\\ntimes caused by excessively high levels of androgens\\nin the blood.

Red blood cells carry\\noxygen in hemoglobin, so that anemia may be caused\\nby a deficiency of blood or red blood cells or of hemo-\\nglobin. These conditions may be caused by a variety\\nof other conditions. Injury can cause blood loss, which\\nin turn can cause anemia. Nutritional deficiency,\\ninadequate amounts of some of thevitamins and\\nminerals that are needed for hemoglobin production,\\nmay also cause anemia. Because hemoglobin is the\\npigment that makes blood cells red, a lack of hemo-\\nglobin will cause the cells to be a paler color, leading\\nto the term hypochromic, lacking in color.\\nOther conditions can also cause anemia. For\\nexample, certain diseases cause the condition. These\\ncan include infections andkidney disease, in which\\nthere is a deficiency of erythropoietin, a material pro-\\nduced in the kidneys which is essential for the produc-\\ntion of red blood cells. Certain genetic conditions\\naffect the absorption of nutrients and may lead to\\nanemia. In sickle cell anemia, a genetic condition in\\nwhich the red cells are curved rather than flat, the red\\ncells have reduced ability to carry oxygen.\\nThe Merck Manualreduces all types of anemia to\\nthree classes:\\n/C15blood loss\\n/C15inadequate production of blood\\n/C15excessive breakdown of blood cells\\nAnemia may be caused by one or a combination\\nof these three factors. Drug therapy is available for\\nmany types of anemia; however, the selection of the\\ndrug depends on proper diagnosis of the cause of the\\nanemia.\\nDescription\\nAnemia caused by blood loss is normally treated\\nwith either blood volume expanders such as plasma or\\nwith related blood products. More severe blood loss\\nmay require transfusions of red blood cells.\\nIn some cases, blood loss may be due to ulcers of\\nthe stomach or intestines. In these cases, treatment of\\nthe underlying cause will normally correct the anemia.\\nIron deficiency\\nThe most common cause of anemia in adults is\\niron deficiency. Although the typical American diet\\ncontains enough iron to meet normal needs, individuals\\nwho are less able to absorb and store iron may experi-\\nence inadequate hemoglobin production. Although the\\nbest way to meet daily iron requirements is through\\nimproved diet, iron supplements are widely used.\\nIron is normally taken in the form of ferrous\\nsulfate. Although other iron salts are commercially\\navailable and make claims of fewer or less severe side\\neffects, these benefits may be related to the fact that\\nother preparations conta i nl e s si r o nb yw e i g h t .\\nFerrous sulfate contains about 37% iron, while fer-\\nrous gluconate contains only about 13% iron. People\\nwho have trouble with the side effects of ferrous\\nsulfate may benefit from some of the specialty pre-\\nparations available, but ferrous sulfate normally\\noffers the greatest amount of iron of all commercial\\nproducts.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAnabolic steroid— Drugs, derived from the male\\nsex hormones, which increase the rate of tissue\\ngrowth. They are best known for increasing the\\nrate of muscle development.\\nAnemia— Any condition in which the amount of\\nhemoglobin in red cells, the number of red cells,\\nor the size of the red cells in blood is reduced from\\nthe normal.\\nCrohn’s disease— Chronic inflammation of the\\nintestine.\\nHemochromatosis— A disorder of iron metabolism\\ncharacterized by excessive absorption of iron from\\nfood.\\nHemoglobin— The red protein found in blood cells\\nwhich carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues.\\nHemolytic anemia— A type of anemia marked by\\nthe breakdown of red blood cells causing the\\nrelease of hemoglobin.\\nSickle cell anemia— An inherited condition,\\nmarked by crescent-shaped red blood cells and\\nred cell breakdown.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 249\\nAntianemia drugs'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 279, 'page_label': '280'}, page_content='Recommended dosage\\nDosage should be calculated by iron needs, based\\non laboratory tests. Manufacturers recommend one\\ntablet a day, containing 65 mg of iron, as a supplement\\nfor patients over the age of 12 years.\\nPrecautions\\nIron can lead to lethalpoisoning in children. All\\niron supplements should be kept carefully out of reach\\nof children.\\nSome types of anemia do not respond to iron\\ntherapy, and the use of iron should be avoided in\\nthese cases. People with acquiredhemolytic anemia,\\nautoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemochromatosis,\\nhemolytic anemia and hemosiderosis should not take\\niron supplements. Hemolytic anemia is caused by\\nthe increased breakdown of red blood cells.\\nHemochromatosis and hemosiderosis and are condi-\\ntions in which there is too much, rather than too little,\\nabsorption of iron.\\nIron supplements should also be avoided by peo-\\nple who have gastric or intestinal ulcers,ulcerative\\ncolitis,o r Crohn’s disease. These conditions marked\\nby inflammation of the digestive tract, which would be\\nmade worse by use of iron.\\nSide effects\\nThe most common side effects of iron consump-\\ntion are stomach and intestinal problems, including\\nstomach upset with cramps, constipation, diarrhea,\\nnausea, and vomiting. At least 25% of patients have\\none or more of these side effects. The frequency and\\nseverity of the side effects increases with the dose of\\niron. Less frequent side effects includeheartburn and\\nurine discoloration.\\nInteractions\\nIron supplements should not be taken at the same\\ntime asantibiotics of either the tetracycline or quino-\\nlone types. The iron will reduce the effectiveness of the\\nantibiotic. Also, iron supplements reduces the effec-\\ntiveness of levodopa, which is used in treatment of\\nParkinson’s disease.\\nIron supplements should not be used with magne-\\nsium trisilicate, an antacid, or with penicillamine,\\nwhich is used for some types of arthritis.\\nTaking iron with vitamin C increases the absorp-\\ntion of iron, with no increase in side effects.\\nFolic acid\\nFolic acid is found in many common foods,\\nincluding liver, dried peas, lentils, oranges, whole-\\nwheat products, asparagus, beets, broccoli, brussel\\nsprouts, and spinach. However, in some cases, patients\\nhave difficulty absorbing folic acid or in converting it\\nfrom the form found in foods to the form that is active\\nin blood formation. In these cases, folic acid tablets are\\nappropriate for use.\\nRECOMMENDED DOSAGE. For treatment of ane-\\nmia, a daily dose of 1 mg is generally used. Patients\\nwho have trouble absorbing folic acid may require\\nhigher doses.\\nMaintenance doses are:\\n/C15infants: 0.1 mg/day\\n/C15children (under 4 years of age): up to 0.3 mg/day\\n/C15children (over 4 years of age) and adults: 0.4 mg/day\\n/C15pregnant and lactating women: 0.8 mg/day\\nPRECAUTIONS. Before treating an anemia with\\nfolic acid, diagnostic tests must be performed to verify\\nthe cause of the anemia.Pernicious anemiacaused by\\nlack of vitamin B12 shows symptoms that are very\\nsimilar to those of folic acid deficiency but also causes\\nnerve damage which shows up as atingling sensation\\nand feelings ofnumbness. Giving folic acid to patients\\nwith B12 deficiency anemia improves the blood cell\\ncount, but the nerve damage continues to progress.\\nSIDE EFFECTS. Folic acid is considered extremely\\nsafe, and there are no predictable side effects. Where\\nside effects have been reported, they have been among\\npatients taking many times more than the normal\\ntherapeutic dose of the drug.\\nOn rare occasions allergic reactions to folic acid\\nhave been reported.\\nINTERACTIONS. Phenytoins, used to treat seizure\\ndisorders, interact with folic acid with a reduction in\\nphenytoin effectiveness and an increased risk of\\nseizures. If the two drugs must be used together, phe-\\nnytoin blood levels should be monitored, and the dose\\nmay have to be increased.\\nTrimethoprim (an antibacterial) and methotrex-\\nate (originally an anti-cancer drug, which is also used\\nfor arthritis andpsoriasis) act by reducing the meta-\\nbolism of folic acid.

The vitamin has many functions in the\\nbody, including maintaining the nervous system, but\\nin treatment of anemia B12 is needed for the metabo-\\nlism of folic acid. Lack of B12 causes pernicious ane-\\nmia, a type of anemia which is marked by a low red cell\\ncount and lack of hemoglobin. There are many other\\nsymptoms of pernicious anemia, including a feeling of\\ntingling or numbness,shortness of breath, muscle\\nweakness, faintness, and a smooth tongue. If perni-\\ncious anemia is left untreated for more than three\\nmonths, permanent damage to the nerves of the spinal\\ncord may result.\\nRECOMMENDED DOSAGE. While vitamin B12 can\\nbe given by mouth for mild vitamin deficiency states,\\npernicious anemia should always be treated with injec-\\ntions, either under the skin (subcutaneous) or into\\nmuscle (intramuscular). Hydroxocobalamine should\\nonly be injected into muscle. Intravenous injections\\nare not used because the vitamin is eliminated from\\nthe body too quickly when given this way. Elderly\\npatients, whose ability to absorb vitamin B12 through\\nthe stomach may be impaired, should also be treated\\nwith injections only.\\nThe normal dose of cyanocobalamine is 100 mcg\\n(micrograms) daily for six to seven days. If improve-\\nment is seen, the dose may be reduced to 100 mcg every\\nother day for seven doses and then 100 mcg every three\\nto four days for two to three weeks.

Diarrhea and itching of the skin\\nhave been reported on rare occasions. Moreover,\\nthere have been reports of severe allergic reactions to\\ncyanocobalamine.\\nINTERACTIONS. Aminosalicylic acid may reduce\\nthe effectiveness of vitamin B12. Also, colchicine, a\\ndrug used for gout, may reduce the effectiveness\\nof vitamin B12. Other, infrequently used drugs and\\nexcessive use of alcohol may also affect the efficacy\\nof vitamin B12. Patients being treated for anemia\\nshould discuss all medications, both prescription\\nand nonprescription, with their physician or\\npharmacist.\\nAnabolic steroids\\nThe anabolic steroids (nandrolone, oxymetho-\\nlone, oxandrolone, and stanzolol) are the same drugs\\nthat are used improperly by body builders to increase\\nmuscle mass. Two of these drugs, nandrolone and\\noxymetholone, are approved for use in treatment of\\nanemia. Nandrolone is indicated for treatment of ane-\\nmia caused by kidney failure, while oxymetholone\\nmay be used to treat anemia caused by insufficient\\nred cell production, such asaplastic anemia.\\nAll anabolic steroids are considered to be drugs of\\nabuse under United States federal law.\\nRECOMMENDED DOSAGE. The information that\\nfollows is specific only to oxymetholone; however,\\nthe warnings and precautions apply to all drugs in\\nthe class of anabolic steroids.\\nThe dosage of oxymetholone must be individual-\\nized. The most common dose is 1 to 2 mg per kilogram\\nof body weight per day, although doses as high as 5 mg\\nper kilogram per day have been used.

By\\nrelaxing the blood vessels, antiangina drugs reduce the\\nheart’s work load and increase the amount of oxygen-\\nrich blood that reaches the heart. These drugs come in\\ndifferent forms, and are used in three main ways:\\n/C15taken regularly over a long period, they reduce the\\nnumber of angina attacks.\\n/C15taken just before some activity that usually brings on\\nan attack, such as climbing stairs, they prevent attacks.\\n/C15taken when an attack begins, they relieve the pain\\nand pressure.\\nNot every form of antiangina drug can be used in\\nevery way. Some work too slowly to prevent attacks\\nthat are about to begin or to relieve attacks that have\\nalready started. These forms can be used only to\\nreduce the number of attacks. Be sure to understand\\nhow and when to use the type of antiangina drug that\\nhas been prescribed.\\nDescription\\nAntiangina drugs, also known as nitrates, come in\\nmany different forms: tablets and capsules that are\\nswallowed; tablets that are held under the tongue,\\ninside the lip, or in the cheek until they dissolve;\\nstick-on patches; ointment; and in-the-mouth sprays.\\nCommonly used antiangina drugs include isosorbide\\ndinitrate (Isordil, Sorbitrate, and other brands) and\\nnitroglycerin (Nitro-Bid, Nitro-Dur, Nitrolingual\\nSpray, Nitrostat Tablets, Transderm-Nitro, and\\nother brands).

A number of medicines already approved\\nby the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\\nhave also been found to possess antiangiogenic proper-\\nties, including celecoxib (Celebrex), bortezomib\\n(Velcade), and interferon. Many inhibitors are currently\\nbeing tested in clinical trials for a variety of diseases in\\nhuman patients, and some in veterinary settings.\\nThese diseases include:\\n/C15Eye disease—Excessive new blood vessels growing in\\nthe eye can cause vision loss and lead to blindness.\\nAntiangiogenic treatments may prevent progressive\\nloss of vision or even improve eyesight in patients.\\n/C15Arthritis—Blood vessels that invade the joint release\\nenzymes that destroy cartilage and other tissues in\\narthritis. Antiangiogenic drugs may relieve the arthritic\\npainand prevent bone joint destruction caused by\\nthese pathological and destructive blood vessels.\\n/C15Cancer—Tumors recruit their own private blood\\nsupply to obtain oxygen and nourishment for cancer\\ncells. By cutting off tumor vasculature (the arrange-\\nment of blood vessels in the body or in a particular\\norgan or tissue), antiangiogenesis therapies may lit-\\nerally starve tumors, and prevent their growth and\\nspread. Antiangiogenesis may also prove to be useful\\nwhen combined with conventionalchemotherapy or\\nradiation therapy, as part of a ‘‘multiple warhead’’\\napproach to attack cancer via different strategies\\nsimultaneously.\\nCurrently, more than 80 antiangiogenic drugs are\\nbeing tested worldwide in human clinical trials\\nsponsored by biotechnology and pharmaceutical com-\\npanies, top medical centers, and the U.S. National\\nCancer Institute. The Angiogenesis Foundation is\\nleading the application of antiangiogenic therapy in\\nveterinary medicine, for treatment of certain condi-\\ntions in dogs, cats, and exotic animal species.\\nPro-angiogenic therapy works the opposite way as\\nantiangiogenic therapy by using angiogenic growth\\nfactors or gene therapy to stimulate blood vessel\\ngrowth in tissues that require an improved blood\\nsupply. A number of angiogenic growth factors and\\ngene therapies are currently undergoing clinical trials\\nin human patients suffering from the following condi-\\ntions: ischemic heart disease,stroke, peripheral vascu-\\nlar disease, and chronicwounds.\\nPrecautions\\nSince antiangiogenic therapy is still experimental,\\nonly people enrolled in a clinical trial of a particular\\ndrug therapy can use it.

Despite the setbacks, however,\\nangiogenesis remains a very tempting target, and\\nresearchers are exploring new agents and approaches\\nto maximize the effects of antiangiogenic therapies.\\nNewer studies have demonstrated that in addition\\nto differences in the regulation of new blood vessel for-\\nmation in cancer compared with normal tissues, the\\nactual blood vessels that are ‘‘created’’ in cancers are\\ndifferent from those created in normal tissues. These\\ndifferences have allowed a number of antiangiogenic\\ndrugs to be developed that specifically damage tumor-\\nassociated blood vessels and not normal vessels. The\\ngoal of these drugs is to attack cancers by damaging\\ntheir blood supply. Many antiangiogenic agents also\\nappear to hasten the death of tumor-associated blood\\nvessels.\\nWith the success of targeted agents such as the\\nbiotechnology company Genentech’s Avastin, the\\nonly antiangiogenic drug approved by the FDA to\\ntreat cancer, new efforts are underway to widen and\\noptimize the field of antiangiogenic agents.

The goal of antiangio-\\ngenic drugs is to stop the development and spread of\\ncertain diseases, especially some cancers. At least four\\nmajor proteins and their receptors and signaling path-\\nways commonly govern angiogenesis in solid tumors:\\nplatelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth fac-\\ntor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and\\nfibroblast growth factor (basic and acidic). Therapies\\nthat either target these molecules or block their signal-\\ning pathways should be effective in preventing solid\\ntumor growth and spread of the cancer by preventing\\nthe formation of new blood vessels.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCooke, Robert.Dr. Folkman’s War: Angiogenesis and the\\nStruggle to Defeat CancerCollingdale, PA: Diane\\nPublishing Co., 2003.\\nTeicher, Beverly A.Antiangiogenic Agents in Cancer Therapy\\nTotowa, NJ: Humana Press, 1999.\\nPERIODICALS\\nFrankish, Helen. ‘‘Researchers Target Tumour Blood\\nVessels With Antiangiogenic Gene Therapy.’’The\\nLancet (June 29, 2002): 2256.\\nGuttman, Cheryl. ‘‘Anti-Angiogenic Therapy Explored for\\nRetinoblastoma.’’ Ophthalmology Times(September 1,\\n2004): 11.\\nMarch, Keith. ‘‘New Approach for Easing Angina.’’\\nMedical Update(December 2003): 6.\\nSullivan.

Clinically significant anxiety is marked by\\nseveral symptoms. The patient experiences marked\\nor persistent fear of one or more social or performance\\nsituations in which he or she is exposed to unfamiliar\\npeople or possible scrutiny by others, and may react in\\na humiliating or embarrassing way. The exposure to\\nthe feared situation produces an anxiety attack. Fear\\nof these episodes of anxiety leads to avoidance beha-\\nvior, which impairs normal social functioning, includ-\\ning working or attending classes. The patient is aware\\nthat these fears are unjustified.\\nDescription\\nIn psychiatric practice, treatment of anxiety has\\nlargely turned from traditional antianxiety agents,\\nanxiolytics, to antidepressant therapies. In current\\nuse, thebenzodiazepines, the best known class of anxio-\\nlytics, have been largely supplanted byselective seroto-\\nnin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs). Among the preferred\\nSSRIs forgeneralized anxiety disorderare paroxetine\\n(Paxil), escitalopram (Lexapro), and venlafaxine\\n(Effexor), which also has norepinephrine. Other\\nSSRIs are fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft).\\nVenlafaxine and Paroxetine have been shown particu-\\nlarly effective in relieving symptoms of social anxiety.\\nHowever, traditional anxiolytics remain useful for\\npatients who need a rapid onset of action, or whose\\nfrequency of exposure to anxiety provoking stimuli is\\nlow enough to eliminate the need for continued treat-\\nment. While SSRIs may require three to five weeks to\\nshow any effects, and must be taken continuously,\\nbenzodiazepines may produce a response within 30\\nminutes, and may be dosed on an as-needed basis.\\nThe intermediate action benzodiazepines, alprazo-\\nlam (Xanax), and lorazepam (Ativan) are the appropri-\\nate choice for treatment of mild anxiety and social\\nphobia. Diazepam (Valium) is still widely used for anxi-\\nety, but its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, which\\nhas a long half-life, may make this a poorer choice than\\nother drugs in its class. There is considerable variation\\nbetween individuals in metabolism of benzodiazepines,\\nso patient response may not be predictable. As a class,\\nbenzodiazepines are used not only as anxiolytics, but\\nalso as sedatives,muscle relaxants, and in treatment of\\nepilepsy andalcoholism.

If something goes wrong with this control\\nsystem, the result may be an irregular heartbeat, or an\\narrhythmia. Antiarrhythmic drugs correct irregular\\nheartbeats, restoring the normal rhythm. If the heart\\nis beating too fast, these drugs will slow it down. By\\ncorrecting these problems, antiarrhythmic drugs help\\nthe heart work more efficiently.\\nDescription\\nAntiarrhythmic drugs are available only with a\\nphysician’s prescription and are sold in capsule (regu-\\nlar and extended release), tablet (regular and\\nextended-release), and injectable forms. Commonly\\nused antiarrhythmic drugs are disopyramide\\n(Norpace, Norpace CR), procainamide (Procan SR,\\nPronestyl, Pronestyl-SR), and quinidine (Cardioquin,\\nDuraquin, Quinidex, and other brands).Do not con-\\nfuse quinidine with quinine, which is a related medicine\\nwith different uses, such as relieving leg cramps.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nantiarrhythmic drug and other factors. Doses may be\\ndifferent for different patients. Check with the physi-\\ncian who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who\\nfilled the prescription for the correct dosage.\\nAlways take antiarrhythmic drugs exactly as\\ndirected. Never take larger or more frequent doses.\\nDo not stop taking this medicine without checking\\nwith the physician who prescribed it. Stopping it sud-\\ndenly could lead to a serious change in heart function.\\nAntiarrhythmic drugs work best when they are at\\nconstant levels in the blood. To help keep levels con-\\nstant, take the medicine in doses spaced evenly through\\nthe day and night. Do not miss any doses. If taking\\nmedicine at night interferes with sleep, or if it is difficult\\nto remember to take the medicine during the day, check\\nwith a health care professional for suggestions.\\nPrecautions\\nPersons who take these drugs should see their\\nphysician regularly. The physician will check to make\\nsure the medicine is working as it should and will note\\nany unwanted side effects.\\nSome people feel dizzy, lightheaded, or faint when\\nusing these drugs. This medicine may cause blurred\\nvision or other vision problems. Because of these pos-\\nsible problems, anyone who takes these drugs should\\nnot drive, use machines or do anything else that might\\nbe dangerous until they have found out how the drugs\\naffect them. If the medicine does cause vision pro-\\nblems, wait until vision is clear before driving or\\nengaging in other activities that require normal vision.\\nAntiarrhythmic drugs make some people feel light-\\nheaded, dizzy, or faint when they get up after sitting or\\nlying down.

Their airways become inflamed\\nand blocked with mucus during asthma attacks, nar-\\nrowing the opening through which air passes. This is\\nnot such a problem when the person breathes in,\\nbecause the airways naturally expand when a person\\ntakes a breath. The real problem arises when the per-\\nson with asthma tries to breathe out. The air cannot\\nget out through the blocked airways, so it stays\\ntrapped in the lungs. With each new breath, the person\\ncan take in only a little more air, so breathing becomes\\nshallow and takes more and more effort.\\nAsthma attacks can be caused byallergies to pol-\\nlen, dust, pets or other things, but people without\\nknown allergies may also have asthma.Exercise, stress,\\nintense emotions, exposure to cold, certain medicines\\nand some medical conditions also can bring on attacks.\\nThe two main approaches to dealing with asthma\\nare avoiding substances and situations that trigger\\nattacks and using medicines that treat or prevent the\\nsymptoms. With a combination of the two, most peo-\\nple with asthma can find relief and live normal lives.\\nDescription\\nThree types of drugs are used in treating and pre-\\nventing asthma attacks:\\n/C15Bronchodilators relax the smooth muscles that line\\nthe airway. This makes the airways open wider, let-\\nting more air pass through them. These drugs are\\nused mainly to relieve sudden asthma attacks or to\\nprevent attacks that might come on after exercise.\\nThey may be taken by mouth, injected or inhaled.\\nBronchodilators may be taken in pill or liquid form,\\nbut normally are used as inhalers, which go directly\\nto the lungs and result in fewer side effects.\\n/C15Corticosteroids block the inflammation that narrows\\nthe airways. Used regularly, these drugs will help pre-\\nvent asthma attacks. Those attacks that do occur will\\nbe less severe. However, corticosteroids cannot stop\\nan attack that is already underway. These drugs may\\nbe taken by mouth, injected or inhaled.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAsthma— A disease in which the air passages of the\\nlungs become inflamed and narrowed.\\nInflammation— Pain, redness, swelling, and heat\\nthat usually develop in response to injury or illness.\\nInhalant— Medicine that is breathed into the lungs.\\nMucus— Thick fluid produced by the moist mem-\\nbranes that line many body cavities and structures.\\nNebulizer— A device that turns liquid forms of\\nmedicine into a fine spray that can be inhaled.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 263\\nAntiasthmatic drugs'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 293, 'page_label': '294'}, page_content='/C15Leukotriene modifiers (montelukast and zafirlukast)\\nare a new type of drug that can be used in place of\\nsteroids, for older children or adults who have a mild\\ndegree of asthma that persists.

In the long\\nrun, patients are better off using bronchodilators only as\\nd i r e c t e da n da l s ou s i n gc o r t i costeroids, which eventually\\nwill reduce their need for bronchodilators. However, a\\n2004 Canadian study has questioned a standard practice\\nof increasing steroids aftera s t h m aa t t a c k so rw o r s e n e d\\nsymptoms. Also, research in 2004 showed that people\\nwith asthma who worked closely with their physicians to\\nself-manage their asthma had fewer attacks, which\\nreduces the need for bronchodilators. Carefully mana-\\nging asthma also reduces visits to the emergency depart-\\nment and hospitalizations.\\nCorticosteroids are powerful drugs that may\\ncause serious side effects when used over a long time.\\nHowever, these problems are much less likely with the\\ninhalant forms than with the oral and injected forms.\\nWhile the oral and injected forms generally should be\\nused only for one to two weeks, the inhalant forms\\nmay be used for long periods.\\nIt is important to remember that leukotriene modi-\\nfiers are used to prevent and manage asthma, not to\\nstop an attack. A physician or pharmacist can advise\\npatients on possible interactions with other drugs.\\nPatients who are using their antiasthmatic drugs\\ncorrectly but feel their asthma is not under control\\nshould see their physicians. The physician can either\\nincrease the dose, switch to another medicine or add\\nanother medicine to the regimen. A 2004 survey\\nshowed that 70% of people with mild to moderate\\nasthma were not taking the correct dose of asthma\\nmedication.\\nWhen used to prevent asthma attacks, cromolyn\\nmust be taken as directed every day. The drug may\\ntake as long as four weeks to start working. Unless\\ntold to do so by a physician, patients should not stop\\ntaking the drug just because it does not seem to be\\nworking. When symptoms do begin to improve,\\npatients should continue taking all medicines that\\nhave been prescribed, unless a physician directs\\notherwise.\\nSide effects\\nInhalant forms of antiasthmatic drugs may cause\\ndryness or irritation in the throat,dry mouth,o ra n\\nunpleasant taste in the mouth. To help prevent these\\nproblems, gargling and rinsing the mouth or taking a\\nsip of water after each dose is recommended.\\nMore serious side effects are not common when\\nthese medicines are used properly.

The bacteriaClostridia difficileare normally\\nfound in the intestines of 5% of healthy adults, but\\npeople can also pick up the bacteria while they are in a\\nhospital or nursing home. In a healthy person, harmless\\nresident intestinal bacteria compete with each other for\\nfood and places to ‘‘sit’’ along the inner intestinal wall.\\nWhenantibioticsare given, most of the resident bacteria\\nare killed. With fewer bacteria to compete with, the\\nnormally harmlessClostridia difficilegrow rapidly and\\nproduce toxins. These toxins damage the inner wall of\\nthe intestines and cause inflammation anddiarrhea.\\nAlthough all antibiotics can cause this disease, it is\\nmost commonly caused by clindamycin (Cleocin), ampi-\\ncillin (Omnipen), amoxicillin (Amoxil, Augmentin, or\\nWymox), and any in the cephalosporin class (such as\\ncefazolin or cephalexin). Symptoms of the condition can\\noccur during antibiotic treatment or within four weeks\\nafter the treatment has stopped.\\nIn approximately half of cases of antibiotic-asso-\\nciated colitis, the condition progresses to a more severe\\nform of colitis called pseudomembranous enterocolitis\\nin which pseudomembranes are excreted in the stools.\\nPseudomembranes are membrane-like collections of\\nwhite blood cells, mucus, and the protein that causes\\nblood to clot (fibrin) that are released by the damaged\\nintestinal wall.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAntibiotic-associated colitis is caused by toxins\\nproduced by the bacteriumClostridium difficile after\\ntreatment with antibiotics. When most of the other\\nintestinal bacteria have been killed,Clostridium diffi-\\ncile grows rapidly and releases toxins that damage the\\nintestinal wall. The disease and symptoms are caused\\nby these toxins, not by the bacterium itself.\\nSymptoms of antibiotic-associated colitis usually\\nbegin four to ten days after antibiotic treatment has\\nbegun. The early signs and symptoms of this disease\\ninclude lower abdominal cramps, an increased need to\\npass stool, and watery diarrhea. As the disease pro-\\ngresses, the patient may experience a general ill feeling,\\nfatigue, abdominalpain, andfever. If the disease pro-\\nceeds to pseudomembranous enterocolitis, the patient\\nmay also experiencenausea, vomiting, large amounts\\nof watery diarrhea, and a very high fever (104-1058F/\\n40-40.5 8C). Complications of antibiotic-associated\\ncolitis include severe dehydration, imbalances in\\nblood minerals, low blood pressure, fluid accumula-\\ntion in deep skin (edema), enlargement of the large\\nintestine (toxic megacolon), and the formation of a\\ntear (perforation) in the wall of the large intestine.\\nThe Clostridium difficile toxin is found in the\\nstools of persons older than 60 years of age 20-100\\ntimes more frequently than in the stools of persons\\nwho are 10-20 years old. As a result, the elderly are\\nmuch more prone to developing antibiotic-associated\\ncolitis than younger individuals.\\nDiagnosis\\nAntibiotic-associated colitis can be diagnosed by\\nthe symptoms and recent medical history of the\\npatient, by a laboratory test for the bacterial toxin,\\nand/or by using a procedure called endoscopy.\\nIf the diarrhea and related symptoms occurred after\\nthe patient received antibiotics, antibiotic-associated\\ncolitis may be suspected. A stool sample may be analyzed\\nfor the presence of theClostridium difficiletoxin. This\\ntoxin test is the preferred diagnostic test for antibiotic-\\nassociated colitis. One frequently used test for the toxin\\ninvolves adding the processed stool sample to a human\\ncell culture. If the toxin is present in the stool sample, the\\ncells die. It may take up to two days to get the results\\nKEY TERMS\\nColitis— Inflammation of the colon.\\nEdema— Fluid accumulation in a tissue.\\nEndoscopy— A procedure in which a thin, lighted\\ninstrument is inserted into the interior of a hollow\\norgan, such as the rectum and used to visually\\ninspect the inner intestinal lining.\\nFibrin— A fibrous blood protein vital to coagulation\\nand blood clot formation.\\nRectum— The last part of the intestine.

A simpler test, which provides results in\\ntwo to three hours, is also available. Symptoms and toxin\\ntest results are usually enough to diagnose the disease.\\nAnother tool that may be useful in the diagnosis\\nof antibiotic-associated colitis, however, is a proce-\\ndure called an endoscopy that involves inserting a\\nthin, lighted tube into the rectum to visually inspect\\nthe intestinal lining. Two different types of endoscopy\\nprocedures, the sigmoidoscopy and the colonoscopy,\\nare used to view different parts of the large intestine.\\nThese procedures are performed in a hospital or doc-\\ntor’s office. Patients are sedated during the procedure\\nto make them more comfortable and are allowed to go\\nhome after recovering from thesedation.\\nTreatment\\nDiarrhea, regardless of the cause, is always treated\\nby encouraging the individual to replace lost fluids and\\nprevent dehydration. One method to treat antibiotic-\\nassociated colitis is to simply stop taking the antibiotic\\nthat caused the disease. This allows the normal intest-\\ninal bacteria to repopulate the intestines and inhibits\\nthe overgrowth ofClostridium difficile.M a n yp a t i e n t s\\nwith mild disease respond well to this and are free from\\ndiarrhea within two weeks. It is important, however, to\\nmake sure that the original disease for which the anti-\\nbiotics were prescribed is treated.\\nBecause of the potential seriousness of this disease,\\nmost patients are given another antibiotic to control the\\ngrowth of theClostridium difficile, usually vancomycin\\n(Vancocin) or metronidazole (Flagyl or Protostat). Both\\nare designed to be taken orally four times a day for 10-14\\ndays. Upon finishing antibiotic treatment, approxi-\\nmately 15-20% of patients will experience a relapse of\\ndiarrhea within one to five weeks. Mild relapses can go\\nuntreated with great success, however, severe relapses of\\ndiarrhea require another round of antibiotic treatment.\\nInstead of further antibiotic treatment, a cholestyramine\\nresin (Questran or Prevalite) may be given. The bacterial\\ntoxins produced in the intestine stick to the resin and are\\npassed out with the resin in the stool. Unfortunately,\\nhowever, vancomycin also sticks to the resin, so these\\ntwo drugs cannot be taken at the same time. Serious\\ndisease may require hospitalization so that the patient\\ncan be monitored, treated, and rehydrated.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThe goal of alternative treatment for antibiotic-\\nassociated enterocolitis is to repopulate the intestinal\\nenvironment with microorganisms that are normal and\\nhealthy for the intestinal tract. These microorgansisms\\nthen compete for space and keep the Clostridium\\ndifficile from over-populating.\\nSeveral types of supplements can be used.\\nSupplements containingLactobacillus acidophilus,t h e\\nbacteria commonly found in yogurt and some types of\\nmilk, Lactobacillus bifidus,a n dStreptococcus faecium,\\nare available in many stores in powder, capsule, tablet,\\nand liquid form.Acidophilus also acts as a mild anti-\\nbiotic, which helps it to reestablish itself in the intestine,\\nand all may aid in the production of some Bvitamins\\nand vitamin K. These supplements can be taken indivi-\\ndually and alternated weekly or together following one\\nor more courses of antibiotics.\\nPrognosis\\nWith appropriate treatment and replenishment of\\nfluids, the prognosis is generally excellent. One or more\\nrelapses can occur. Very severe colitis can cause a tear\\n(perforation) in the wall of thelarge intestine that would\\nrequire major surgery. Perforation of the intestine can\\ncause a serious abdominal infection. Antibiotic-asso-\\nciated colitis can be fatal in people who are elderly\\nand/or have a serious underlying illness, such ascancer.\\nPrevention\\nThere are no specific preventative measures for this\\ndisease. Good general health can reduce the chance of\\ndeveloping a bacterial infection that would require anti-\\nbiotic treatment and the chance of picking up the\\nClostridiabacteria. Maintaining good general health\\ncan also reduce the seriousness and length of the con-\\ndition, should it develop following antibiotic therapy.\\nResources\\nOTHER\\nMayo Clinic Online.March 5, 1998. <http://\\nwww.mayohealth.org>.\\nBelinda Rowland, PhD\\nAntibiotic prophylaxis see Prophylaxis\\nAntibiotics\\nDefinition\\nAntibiotics may be informally defined as the sub-\\ngroup of anti-infectives that are derived from bacterial\\nsources and are used to treat bacterial infections.\\nOther classes of drugs, most notably thesulfonamides,\\n266 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAntibiotics'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 296, 'page_label': '297'}, page_content='may be effective antibacterials. Similarly, some anti-\\nbiotics may have secondary uses, such as the use of\\ndemeclocycline (Declomycin, a tetracycline deriva-\\ntive) to treat the syndrome of inappropriate antidiure-\\ntic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Other antibiotics\\nmay be useful in treating protozoal infections.\\nPurpose\\nAntibiotics are used for treatment or prevention\\nof bacterial infection.\\nDescription\\nClassifications\\nAlthough there are several classification schemes\\nfor antibiotics, based on bacterial spectrum (broad\\nversus narrow) or route of administration (injectable\\nversus oral versus topical), or type of activity (bacter-\\nicidal vs. bacteriostatic), the most useful is based on\\nchemical structure. Antibiotics within a structural\\nclass will generally show similar patterns of effective-\\nness, toxicity, and allergic potential.\\nPENICILLINS. The penicillins are the oldest class of\\nantibiotics, and have a common chemical structure\\nwhich they share with the cephalopsorins. The two\\ngroups are classed as the beta-lactam antibiotics, and\\nare generally bacteriocidal—that is, they kill bacteria\\nrather than inhibiting growth. The penicillins can be\\nfurther subdivided. The natural pencillins are based on\\nthe original penicillin G structure; penicillinase-resistant\\npenicillins, notably methicillin and oxacillin, are active\\neven in the presence of the bacterial enzyme that inacti-\\nvates most natural penicillins. Aminopenicillins such as\\nampicillin and amoxicillin have an extended spectrum\\nof action compared with the natural penicillins;\\nextended spectrum penicillins are effective against a\\nwider range of bacteria. These generally include cover-\\nage forPseudomonas aeruginaosaand may provide the\\npenicillin in combination with a penicillinase inhibitor.\\nCEPHALOSPORINS. Cephalosporins and the closely\\nrelated cephamycins and carbapenems, like the pencil-\\nlins, contain a beta-lactam chemical structure.\\nConsequently, there are patterns of cross-resistance\\nand cross-allergenicity among the drugs in these\\nclasses. The ‘‘cepha’’ drugs are among the most diverse\\nclasses of antibiotics, and are themselves subgrouped\\ninto 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations. Each generation has\\na broader spectrum of activity than the one before. In\\naddition, cefoxitin, a cephamycin, is highly active\\nagainst anaerobic bacteria, which offers utility in treat-\\nment of abdominal infections. The 3rd generation\\ndrugs, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone and others,\\ncross the blood-brain barrier and may be used to treat\\nmeningitisand encephalitis. Cephalopsorins are the\\nusually preferred agents for surgicalprophylaxis.\\nFLUROQUINOLONES. The fluroquinolones are syn-\\nthetic antibacterial agents,and not derived from bacteria.\\nThey are included here because they can be readily inter-\\nchanged with traditional antibiotics. An earlier, related\\nclass of antibacterial agents, the quinolones, were not\\nwell absorbed, and could be used only to treat urinary\\ntract infections. The fluroquinolones, which are based\\non the older group, are broad-spectrum bacteriocidal\\ndrugs that are chemically unrelated to the penicillins or\\nthe cephaloprosins. They are well distributed into bone\\ntissue, and so well absorbed that in general they are as\\neffective by the oral route as by intravenous infusion.\\nTETRACYCLINES. Tetracyclines got their name\\nbecause they share a chemical structure that has four\\nrings. They are derived from a species ofStreptomyces\\nbacteria. Broad-spectrum bacteriostatic agents, the tetra-\\ncyclines may be effective against a wide variety of micro-\\norganisms, including rickettsia and amoebic parasites.\\nMACROLIDES. The macrolide antibiotics are\\nderived from Streptomyces bacteria, and got their\\nname because they all have a macrocyclic lactone\\nchemical structure. Erythromycin, the prototype of\\nthis class, has a spectrum and use similar to penicillin.\\nNewer members of the group, azithromycin and\\nclarithyromycin, are particularly useful for their high\\nA penicillin culture.

Many antibiotic first-aid products\\ncontain combinations of antibiotics to make them\\neffective against a broad range of bacteria.\\nWhen treating a wound, it is not enough to simply\\napply a topical antibiotic. The wound must first be\\ncleaned with soap and water and patted dry. After the\\nantibiotic is applied, the wound should be covered\\nwith a dressing, such as a bandage or a protective gel\\nor spray. For many years, it was thought that wounds\\nheal best when exposed to the air. But now most\\nexperts say it is best to keep wounds clean and moist\\nwhile they heal.

Over time, bacteria develop\\nnew defenses against antibiotics that once were effective\\nagainst them. Because bacteria reproduce so quickly,\\nthese defenses can be rapidly passed on through gen-\\nerations of bacteria until almost all are immune to the\\neffects of a particular antibiotic.

To help\\ncontrol the problem, many experts advise people to use\\ntopical antibiotics only for short periods, that is, until\\nthe wound heals, and only as directed. For the topical\\nantibiotic to work best, it should be used only to pre-\\nvent infection in a fresh wound, not to treat an infection\\nthat has already started.

Drug\\ntherapy may be used alone, or in combination with\\nother treatments such as surgery orradiation therapy.\\nPurpose\\nAnticancer drugs are used to control the growth of\\ncancerous cells. Cancer is commonly defined as the\\nuncontrolled growth of cells, with loss of differentia-\\ntion and commonly, with metastasis, spread of the\\ncancer to other tissues and organs. Cancers are malign-\\nant growths. In contrast, benign growths remain\\nencapsulated and grow within a well-defined area.\\nAlthough benign tumors may be fatal if untreated,\\ndue to pressure on essential organs, as in the case of a\\nbenign brain tumor, surgery or radiation are the pre-\\nferred methods of treating growths which have a well\\ndefined location. Drug therapy is used when the tumor\\nhas spread, or may spread, to all areas of the body.\\nDescription\\nSeveral classes of drugs may be used in cancer\\ntreatment, depending on the nature of the organ\\ninvolved. For example, breast cancers are commonly\\nstimulated by estrogens, and may be treated with\\ndrugs that inactivate the sex hormones. Similarly,\\nprostate cancermay be treated with drugs that inacti-\\nvate androgens, the male sex hormone. However, the\\nmajority of antineoplastic drugs act by interfering\\nwith cell growth. Since cancerous cells grow more\\nrapidly than other cells, the drugs target those cells\\nthat are in the process of reproducing themselves. As a\\nresult, antineoplastic drugs will commonly affect not\\nonly the cancerous cells, but others cells that com-\\nmonly reproduce quickly, including hair follicles,\\novaries and testes, and the blood-forming organs.\\nNewer methods of antineoplastic drug therapy\\nhave taken different approaches, including angiogen-\\nesis—the inhibition of formation of blood vessels feed-\\ning the tumor and contributing to tumor growth.\\nAlthough these approaches hold promise, they are\\nnot yet in common use. Developing new anticancer\\ndrugs is the work of ongoing research. In 2003, a new\\ntechnique was developed to streamline the search for\\neffective drugs. Researchers pumped more than 23,000\\nchemical compounds through a screening technique to\\nidentify those that help fight cancer while leaving\\n272 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAnticancer drugs'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 302, 'page_label': '303'}, page_content='healthy cells unharmed.

They inhibit clot formation by blocking the action\\nof clotting factors or platelets. Anticoagulant drugs fall\\ninto three categories: inhibitors of clotting factor synth-\\nesis, inhibitors of thrombin and antiplatelet drugs.\\nPurpose\\nAnticoagulant drugs reduce the ability of the blood\\nto form clots. Although blood clotting is essential to\\nprevent serious bleeding in the case of skin cuts, clots\\ninside the blood vessels block the flow of blood to major\\norgans and cause heart attacks and strokes. Although\\nthese drugs are sometimes called blood thinners, they\\ndo not actually thin the blood. Furthermore, this type\\nof medication will not dissolve clots that already have\\nformed, although the drug stops an existing clot from\\nworsening. However, another type of drug, used in\\nthrombolytic therapy, will dissolve existing clots.\\nAnticoagulant drugs are used for a number of con-\\nditions. For example, they may be given to preventblood\\nclotsfrom forming after the replacement of a heart valve\\nor to reduce the risk of astroke or anotherheart attack\\nafter a first heart attack. They are also used to reduce the\\nchance of blood clots forming during open heart surgery\\nor bypass surgery.

They come in tablet and injectable forms.\\nThey fall into three groups:\\n/C15Inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis. These anti-\\ncoagulants inhibit the production of certain clotting\\nfactors in the liver. One example is warfarin (brand\\nname: coumadin).\\n/C15Inhibitors of thrombin.

The formal diag-\\nnosis requires a cluster of symptoms, lasting at least\\ntwo weeks. These symptoms include, but are not limi-\\nted to, mood changes, insomnia or hypersomnia, and\\ndiminished interest in daily activities. The symptoms\\nare not caused by any medical condition, drug side\\neffect, or adverse life event. The condition is severe\\nenough to cause clinically significant distress or\\nimpairment in social, occupational, or other import-\\nant areas of functioning.\\nSecondary depression, or depression caused by\\nunfavorable life events, is normally self limiting, and\\nmay best be treated with cognitive/behavioral therapy\\nrather than drugs.\\nDescription\\nAntidepressant agents act by increasing the levels\\nof excitatory neurostransmitters, or nerve cell chemicals\\nthat act as messengers in the brain’s nervous system. In\\n2003, a report showed that in addition to treating\\ndepression, use of antidepressant drugs may protect\\nthe brain from damage depressive episodes cause to\\nthe hippocampus, the area of the brain involved in\\nlearning and memory. Antidepressant drugs may be\\nprescribed as a first-line treatment for depression, or\\nin conjunction with other methods of controlling\\ndepression, such as behavioral therapy andexercise.\\nThe main types of antidepressant drugs in use\\ntoday are listed below, though the drugs available\\nchange frequently. For example, in mid-2003, the\\nmanufacturer of Wellbutrin released Wellbutrin XL,\\nthe only once-daily norepinephrine and dopamine\\nreuptake inhibitor for treating depression in adults.\\n/C15tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil),\\nimipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor)\\n/C15selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs or\\nserotonin boosters), such as fluoxetine (Prozac), par-\\noxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft)\\n/C15monoamine oxidase inhibitors(MAO inhibitors), such\\nas phenelzine (Nardil), and tranylcypromine (Parnate)\\nKEY TERMS\\nCognitive behavioral therapy— A type of psy-\\nchotherapy in which people learn to recognize\\nand change negative and self-defeating patterns of\\nthinking and behavior.\\nDepression— A mental condition in which people\\nfeel extremely sad and lose interest in life. People\\nwith depression also may have sleep problems and\\nloss of appetite and may have trouble concentrat-\\ning and carrying out everyday activities.\\nPregnancy category— A system of classifying drugs\\naccording to their established risks for use during\\npregnancy. Category A: Controlled human studies\\nhave demonstrated no fetal risk. Category B:\\nAnimal studies indicate no fetal risk, but no\\nhuman studies; or adverse effects in animals, but\\nnot in well-controlled human studies. Category C:\\nNo adequate human or animal studies; or adverse\\nfetal effects in animal studies, but no available\\nhuman data. Category D: Evidence of fetal risk,\\nbut benefits outweigh risks.

Many millions\\nof Americans have taken Prozac and more than 70%\\nof them claim to have benefited from it. Within a few\\nyears other SSRIs became available and, by 2000, Zoloft\\nprescriptions outnumbered those for Prozac.\\nLexapro is the newest SSRI. Celexa and Lexapro\\nare very similar, with chemical structures unrelated to\\nother SSRIs. Celexa is a mixture of two isomers—\\nforms of the same chemical—whereas Lexapro is the\\nactive isomer alone. They appear to be highly selective\\nfor serotonin, only minimally inhibiting the reuptake\\nof the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopa-\\nmine. Paxil is structurally unrelated to other SSRIs\\nand is more selective for serotonin than Luvox,\\nProzac, or Zoloft, but less selective than Celexa and\\nLexapro. Paxil becomes distributed widely through-\\nout body tissues and the CNS, with only 1% remain-\\ning in the circulatory system.\\nMode of action\\nMental depression is believed to be related to the\\nlow activity of one or more neurotransmitters in the\\nbrain—the chemical messengers that cross the gap or\\nsynapse between nerve cells. Although it is not under-\\nstood exactly how most SSRIs work, they are designed\\nto increase the level of serotonin in the brain. This can\\nreduce the symptoms of depression and other psycho-\\nlogical disorders.\\nSerotonin is released by nerve cells and then—in a\\nprocess called reuptake—is reabsorbed by the cells to\\nbe used again. SSRIs interfere with reuptake by block-\\ning the serotonin reuptake sites on the surfaces of\\nnerve cells, thereby making more serotonin available\\nfor brain activity. Paxil inhibits the transporter mole-\\ncule that moves serotonin back into the cell. SSRIs are\\nsaid to selectively interfere with the reuptake of sero-\\ntonin, without affecting the uptake or activities of\\nother neurotransmitters. In contrast, older antidepres-\\nsants such astricyclic antidepressantsand monoamine\\noxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) affect numerous neuro-\\ntransmitters, brain cell receptors, and brain processes,\\nincreasing the likelihood of serious side effects.\\nHowever it is becoming clear that the serotonin\\nneurotransmitter system is far more complex and wide-\\nspread throughout the body than was thought initially.\\nAlthough serotonin receptors are particularly common\\nin areas of the brain that control emotion, it is known\\nnow that there are at least six different types of serotonin\\nreceptors that send different signals to different parts of\\nthe brain. Serotonin also appears to affect other neuro-\\ntransmitter systems—including dopamine—to at least\\nsome extent. Thus increasing the levels of serotonin may\\nnot be the only reason why SSRIs relieve depression.\\nEffectiveness\\nSSRIs are not effective for treating anxiety or\\ndepression in 20–40% of patients. However some\\nresearch suggests that the use of SSRIs in the early stages\\nof depression can prevent majordepressive disorders.\\nAlthough different SSRIs appear to be equally\\neffective, individuals respond differently to different\\nSSRIs and side effects may vary. Thus finding the best\\nSSRI for an individual may be a matter of trial-and-\\nerror. It usually takes two to four weeks after starting an\\nSSRI before symptoms begin to improve. Luvox may\\ntake one to two months for noticeable improvement.\\nPaxil may take as long as several months, although\\nsleeping often improves within one or two weeks of\\nbeginning the medication. If there is no response after\\na few weeks or if side effects occur, the patient may be\\nswitched to another SSRI. Prozac is the most commonly\\nprescribed SSRI for children, in part because it is avail-\\nable in liquid form that is easier to swallow.\\nAlthough Luvox is the only SSRI that is FDA-\\napproved for use in children—and only for obsessive-\\ncompulsive behavior—thousands of young people\\nhave been treated with SSRIs for:\\n/C15depression\\n/C15anxiety\\n/C15OCD\\n/C15panic\\n/C15attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\\nA 2004 study found that among depressed adoles-\\ncents, 60% improved with Prozac alone, whereas 75%\\nreported improvement with Prozac combined with\\ncognitive behavioral therapy.\\nSSRIs sometimes are prescribed to relieve depres-\\nsion accompanying alcoholism.

Some tricyclic antidepressants are also used\\nto treat bulimia,cocaine withdrawal, panic disorder,\\nobsessive-compulsive disorders, certain types of\\nchronicpain, andbed-wetting in children.\\nDescription\\nNamed for their three-ring chemical structure,\\ntricyclic antidepressants work by correcting chemical\\nimbalances in the brain. But because they also affect\\nother chemicals throughout the body, these drugs may\\nproduce many unwanted side effects.\\nTricyclic antidepressants are available only with a\\nphysician’s prescription and are sold in tablet, capsule,\\nliquid, and injectable forms. Some commonly used\\ntricyclic antidepressants are amitriptyline (Elavil),\\ndesipramine (Norpramin), imipramine (Tofranil),\\nnortriptyline (Pamelor), and protriptyline (Vivactil).\\nDifferent drugs in this family have different effects,\\nand physicians can choose the drug that best fits the\\npatient’s symptoms. For example, a physician might\\nprescribe Elavil for a person with depression who has\\ntrouble sleeping, because this drug is more likely to\\nmake people feel calm and sleepy. Other tricyclic anti-\\ndepressants might be more appropriate for depressed\\npeople with low energy.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on many fac-\\ntors, including the patient’s age, weight, general health\\nand symptoms. The type of tricyclic antidepressant\\nand its strength also must be considered. Check with\\nthe physician who prescribed the drug or the pharma-\\ncist who filled the prescription for the correct dosage.\\nAlways take tricyclic antidepressants exactly as\\ndirected. Never take larger or more frequent doses,\\nand do not take the drug for longer than directed.\\nDo not stop taking the medicine just because it does\\nnot seem to be working. Several weeks may be needed\\nfor its effects to be felt. Visit the physician as often as\\nrecommended so that the physician can check to see if\\nthe drug is working and to note for side effects.\\nDo not stop taking this medicine suddenly after\\ntaking it for several weeks or more. Gradually taper-\\ning the dose may be necessary to reduce the chance of\\nwithdrawal symptoms.\\nTaking this medicine with food may prevent upset\\nstomach.\\nPrecautions\\nThe effects of this medicine may continue for three\\nto seven days after patients stop taking it. All precau-\\ntions should be observed during this period, as well as\\nthroughout treatment with tricyclic antidepressants.\\nSome people feel drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded,\\nwhen taking these drugs. The drugs may also cause\\nblurred vision. Anyone who takes these drugs should\\nnot drive, use machines or do anything else that might\\nbe dangerous until they have found out how the drugs\\naffect them.\\nBecause tricyclic antidepressants work on the cen-\\ntral nervous system, they may add to the effects of\\nalcohol and other drugs that cause drowsiness, such\\nasantihistamines, cold medicine, allergy medicine,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 293\\nAntidepressants, tricyclic'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 323, 'page_label': '324'}, page_content='sleep aids, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some\\npain relievers, andmuscle relaxants.

Type I is\\ncaused by a deficiency of insulin production, while\\ntype II is characterized byinsulin resistance.\\nT r e a t m e n to ft y p eId i a b e t e si sl i m i t e dt oi n s u l i n\\nreplacement, while type II diabetes is treatable by a\\nnumber of therapeutic approaches. Many cases of insu-\\nlin resistance are asymptomatic due to normal increases\\nin insulin secretion, and others may be controlled by\\ndiet andexercise. Drug therapy may be directed toward\\nincreasing insulin secretion, increasing insulin sensitiv-\\nity, or increasing insulin penetration of the cells.\\nDescription\\nAntidiabetic drugs may be subdivided into six\\ngroups: insulin, sufonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibi-\\ntors, biguanides, meglitinides, and thiazolidinediones.\\nInsulin (Humulin, Novolin) is the hormone respon-\\nsible for glucose utilization. It is effective in both types\\nof diabetes, since, even in insulin resistance, some sen-\\nsitivity remains and the condition can be treated with\\nKEY TERMS\\nBlood sugar— The concentration of glucose in the\\nblood.\\nGlucose— A simple sugar that serves as the body’s\\nmain source of energy.\\nHormone— A substance that is produced in one part\\nof the body, then travels through the bloodstream to\\nanother part of the body where it has its effect.\\nMetabolism— All the physical and chemical changes\\nthat occur in cells to allow growth and maintain\\nbody functions. These include processes that break\\ndown substances to yield energy and processes\\nthat build up other substances necessary for life.\\nPregnancy category— A system of classifying drugs\\naccording to their established risks for use during\\npregnancy. Category A: Controlled human studies\\nhave demonstrated no fetal risk. Category B:\\nAnimal studies indicate no fetal risk, but no\\nhuman studies; or adverse effects in animals, but\\nnot in well-controlled human studies. Category C:\\nNo adequate human or animal studies; or adverse\\nfetal effects in animal studies, but no available\\nhuman data. Category D: Evidence of fetal risk,\\nbut benefits outweigh risks. Category X: Evidence\\nof fetal risk. Risks outweigh any benefits.\\nSalicylates— A group of drugs that includes aspirin\\nand related compounds. Salicylates are used to\\nrelieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever.\\nSeizure— A sudden attack, spasm, or convulsion.\\n296 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAntidiabetic drugs'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 326, 'page_label': '327'}, page_content='larger doses of insulin. Most insulins are now produced\\nby recombinant DNA techniques, and are chemically\\nidentical to natural human insulin. Isophane insulin\\nsuspension, insulin zinc suspension, and other formula-\\ntions are intended to extend the duration of insulin\\naction, and permit glucose control over longer periods\\nof time. In 2003, research suggested that inhaled forms\\nof insulin offered advantages to injected types, but\\nfurther study was needed on its long-term effects on\\nthe lungs and cost-effectiveness.\\nSulfonylureas (chlorpropamide [Diabinese], tola-\\nzamide [Tolinase], glipizide [Glucotrol] and others) act\\nby increasing insulin release from the beta cells of the\\npancrease. Glimepiride (Amaryl), a member of this\\nclass, appears to have a useful secondary action in\\nincreasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral cells.\\nAlpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose [Precose],\\nmiglitol [Glyset]) do not enhance insulin secretion.\\nRather, they inhibit the conversion of disaccharides and\\ncomplex carbohydrates to glucose. This mechanism does\\nnot prevent conversion, but only delays it, reducing the\\npeak blood glucose levels. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors\\nare useful for either monotherapy or in combination\\ntherapywithsulfonylureas orotherhypoglycemicagents.\\nMetformin (Glucophage) is the only available mem-\\nber of the biguanide class. Metformin decreases hepatic\\n(liver) glucose production, decreases intestinal absorp-\\ntion of glucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake\\nand use. Metformin may be used as monotherapy\\n(alone), or in combination therapy with a sulfonylurea.\\nThere are two members of the meglitinide class:\\nrepaglinide (Prandin) and nateglitinide (Starlix). The\\nmechanism of action of the meglitinides is to stimulate\\ninsulin production. This activity is both dose dependent\\nand dependent on the presence of glucose, so that the\\ndrugs have reduced effectiveness in the presence of low\\nblood glucose levels. The meglitinides may be used alone,\\nor in combination with metformin. The manufacturer\\nwarns that nateglitinide should not be used in combina-\\ntion with other drugs that enhance insulin secretion.\\nRosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos)\\nare members of the thiazolidinedione class. They act\\nby both reducing glucose production in the liver, and\\nincreasing insulin dependent glucose uptake in muscle\\ncells. They do not increase insulin production. These\\ndrugs may be used in combination with metformin or\\na sulfonylurea.\\nRecommended dosage\\nDosage must be highly individualized for all anti-\\ndiabetic agents and is based on blood glucose levels\\nwhich must be taken regularly. Patients should review\\nspecific literature that comes with antidiabetic medica-\\ntions for complete dosage information.\\nPrecautions\\nInsulin. The greatest short term risk of insulin is\\nhypoglycemia, which may be the result of either a\\ndirect overdose or an imbalance between insulin injec-\\ntion and level of exercise and diet. This also may occur\\nin the presence of other conditions which reduce the\\nglucose load, such as illness withvomiting and diar-\\nrhea. Treatment is with glucose in the form of glucose\\ntablets or liquid, although severe cases may require\\nintravenous therapy. Allergic reactions and skin reac-\\ntions also may occur. Insulin is classified as category B\\ninpregnancy, and is considered the drug of choice for\\nglucose control during pregnancy. Insulin glargine\\n(Lantus), an insulin analog which is suitable for\\nonce-daily dosing, is classified as category C, because\\nthere have been reported changes in the hearts of new-\\nborns in animal studies of this drug. The reports are\\nessentially anecdotal, and no cause and effect relation-\\nship has been determined. Insulin is not recommended\\nduring breast feeding because either low or high\\ndoses of insulin may inhibit milk production. Insulin\\nadministered orally is destroyed in the GI tract, and\\nrepresents no risk to the newborn.\\nSulonylureas. All sulfonylurea drugs may cause\\nhypoglycemia. Most patients become resistant to these\\ndrugs over time, and may require either dose adjust-\\nments or a switch to insulin. The list of adverse reactions\\nis extensive, and includes central nervous system pro-\\nblems and skin reactions, among others. Hematologic\\nreactions, although rare,may be severe and include\\naplastic anemiaand hemolytic anemia.T h ea d m i n i s t r a -\\ntion of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been associated\\nwith increased cardiovascular mortality as compared\\nwith treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. The\\nsulfonylureas are classified as category C during preg-\\nnancy, based on animal studies, although glyburide has\\nnot shown any harm to the fetus and is classified as\\ncategory B.

An average,\\nhealthy person has anywhere from three bowel move-\\nments a day to three a week, depending on that person’s\\ndiet. Normally the stool (the material that is passed in a\\nbowel movement) has a texture something like clay.\\nWithdiarrhea,bowelmovementsmaybemorefrequent,\\nandthetextureofthestool isthinandsometimes watery.\\nDiarrhea is not a disease, but a symptom of some\\nother problem. The symptom may be caused by eating\\nor drinking food or water that is contaminated with\\nbacteria, viruses, or parasites, or by eating something\\nthat is difficult to digest. People who have trouble\\ndigesting lactose (milk sugar), for example, may get\\ndiarrhea if they eat dairy products. Some cases of\\ndiarrhea are caused bystress, while others are brought\\non by taking certain medicines.\\nDescription\\nAntidiarrheal drugs work in several ways. The\\ndrug loperamide, found in Imodium A-D, for example,\\nslows the passage of stools through the intestines. This\\nallows more time for water and salts in the stools to be\\nabsorbed back into the body. Adsorbents, such as atta-\\npulgite (found in Kaopectate) pull diarrhea-causing\\nsubstances from the digestive tract. However, they\\nmay also pull out substances that the body needs,\\nsuch as enzymes and nutrients. Bismuth subsalicylate,\\nthe ingredient in Pepto-Bismol, decreases the secretion\\nof fluid into the intestine and inhibits the activity of\\nbacteria. It not only controls diarrhea, but relieves the\\ncramps that often accompany diarrhea.\\nThese medicines come in liquid, tablet, caplet, and\\nchewable tablet forms and can be bought without a\\nphysician’s prescription.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe dose depends on the type of antidiarrheal\\ndrug. Read and follow the directions on the product\\nlabel. For questions about dosage, check with a phy-\\nsician or pharmacist. Never take larger or more fre-\\nquent doses, and do not take the drug for longer than\\ndirected.\\nPrecautions\\nDiarrhea usually improves within 24-48 hours. If\\nthe problem lasts longer or if it keeps coming back,\\ndiarrhea could be a sign of a more serious problem.\\nAnyone who has any of the symptoms listed below\\nshould get medical attention as soon as possible:\\n/C15diarrhea that lasts more than two days or gets worse\\n/C15fever\\n/C15blood in the stool\\n/C15vomiting\\n/C15cramps or tenderness in the abdomen\\n/C15signs of dehydration, such as decreased urination,\\ndizziness or lightheadedness, dry mouth, increased\\nthirst, or wrinkled skin\\nDo not use antidiarrheal drugs for more than two\\ndays unless told to do so by a physician.\\nSevere, long-lasting dia r r h e ac a nl e a dt od e h y -\\ndration. In such cases, lost fluids and salts, such as\\ncalcium, sodium, and potassium, must be replaced.\\nPeople older than 60 should not use attapulgite\\n(Kaopectate, Donnagel, Parepectolin), but may use\\nother kinds of antidiarrheal drugs. However, people\\nin this age group may be more likely to have side\\neffects, such as severeconstipation, from bismuth sub-\\nsalicylate. Ask the pharmacist for more information.\\nBismuth subsalicylate may cause the tongue or the\\nstool to temporarily darken. This is harmless.\\nHowever, do not confuse this harmless darkening of\\nthe stool with the black, tarry stools that are a sign of\\nbleeding in the intestinal tract.\\nChildren with flu or chicken pox should not be\\ngiven bismuth subsalicylate. It can lead toReye’s syn-\\ndrome, a life-threatening condition that affects the\\nliver and central nervous system. To be safe, never\\ngive bismuth subsalicylate to a child under 16 years\\nwithout consulting a physician.

Drugs that increase ADH levels include\\nacetaminophen, barbiturates, cholinergic agents, estro-\\ngen, nicotine, oralhypoglycemia agents, somediuretics\\n(e.g., thiazides), cyclophosphamide,narcotics, andtri-\\ncyclic antidepressants. Drugs that decrease ADH levels\\ninclude alcohol, beta-adrenergic agents, morphine\\nantagonists, and phenytoin (Dilantin).\\nDescription\\nThe purpose of ADH is to control the amount of\\nwater reabsorbed by the kidneys. Water is continu-\\nally being taken into the body in food and drink, as\\nwell as being produced by chemical reactions in cells.\\nWater is also continually lost in urine, sweat, feces,\\nand in the breath as water vapor. ADH release helps\\nmaintain the optimum amount of water in the body\\nwhen there is an increase in the concentration of the\\nblood serum or a decrease in blood volume. Physical\\nstress, surgery, and high levels ofanxiety can also\\nstimulate ADH.\\nVarious factors can affect ADH production,\\nthereby disturbing the body’s water balance. For\\nexample, alcohol consumption reduces ADH pro-\\nduction by direct action on the brain, resulting in a\\ntemporarily increased production of urine. This may\\nalso occur in diabetes insipidus, when the pituitary\\ngland produces insufficient ADH, or rarely, when the\\nkidneys fail to respond to ADH. The reverse effect of\\nwater retention can result from temporarily\\nincreased ADH production after a major operation\\nor accident. Water retention may also be caused by\\nthe secretion of ADH by some tumors, especially of\\nthe lung.\\nPreparation\\nThe test requires collection of a blood sample.

Most of these\\norganisms cause infections by being ingested in the\\nform of eggs or larvae, usually present on contaminated\\nfood or clothing, while others gain entry through skin\\nabrasions. Common parasitic infestations includeame-\\nbiasis, malaria, giardiasis, hookworm, pinworm,\\nthreadworm, whipworm and tapeworm infestations.\\nOnce in the body, parasitic worms may go unnoticed\\nif they cause no severe symptoms. However, if they\\nmultiply rapidly and spread to a major organ, they\\ncan cause very serious and even life-threatening condi-\\ntions. Antihelminthic drugs are prescribed to treat these\\ninfestations. They function either by destroying the\\nworms on contact or by paralyzing them, or by altering\\nthe permeability of their plasma membranes. The dead\\nworms then pass out of the body in the feces.\\nDescription\\nAntihelminthic drugs are available only with a\\nprescription and are available as liquids, tablets or cap-\\nsules. Some commonly used antihelminthics include:\\nalbendazole (Albenza), mebendazole (Vermox), niclosa-\\nmide (Niclocide), oxamniquine (Vansil), praziquantel\\n(Biltricide), pyrantel (Antiminth), pyantel pamoate\\n(Antiminth) and thiabendazole (Mintezol). Some types\\nof parasitic infestations are rarely seen in the United\\nStates, thus, the corresponding antihelminthic drugs are\\nn o tw i d e l yd i s t r i b u t e da n dn e e dt ob eo b t a i n e df r o mt h e\\nUnited States Center for Disease Control (CDC) when\\nrequired. These include for example bitional and iver-\\nm e c t i n ,u s e dt ot r e a to n c h o c e rciasis infestations. Other\\nantihelminthic drugs, such as diethylcarbamazepine\\ncitrate (Hetrezan), used for treatment of roundworms\\nand other parasites, is supplied directly by its manufac-\\nturer when needed.\\nMost antihelminthic drugs are only active against\\nspecific parasites, some are also toxic. Before treat-\\nment, the parasites must therefore be identified using\\ntests that look for parasites, eggs or larvae in feces,\\nurine, blood, sputum, or tissues. Thus, niclosamide is\\nused against tapeworms, but will not be effective for\\nthe treatment of pinworm or roundworm infestations,\\nbecause it acts by inhibiting ATP production in tape-\\nworm cells. Thiabendazole (Mintezole) is the drug\\nusually prescribed for treatment of threadworm, but\\na similar drug, mebendazole (Vermox) works better on\\nwhipworm by disrupting the microtubules of this\\nworm. Praziquantel is another drug that acts by alter-\\ning the membrane permeability of the worms.\\nPreparation\\nDosage is established depending on the patient’s\\ngeneral health status and age, the type of antihel-\\nminthic drug used, and the type of parasitic infestation\\nbeing treated. The number of doses per day, the time\\nbetween doses, and the length of treatment will also\\ndepend on these factors.\\nAntihelminthic drugs must be taken exactly as\\ndirected to completely rid the body of the parasitic\\ninfestation, and for as long as directed. A second\\nround of treatment may be required to ensure that\\nthe infection has completely cleared.\\nPrecautions\\nSome antihelminthic drugs work best when ingested\\nalong with fatty foods, such as milk or ice cream. Oral\\ndrugs should be taken with water during or after meals.\\nThe prescribing physician should be informed if the\\npatient has a low-fat or other special diet.\\nSome antihelminthic drugs, such as praziquantel,\\ncome in chewable form. These tablets should not be\\nchewed or kept in the mouth, but should swallowed\\nwhole because their bitter taste may cause gagging or\\nvomiting.\\nAntihelminthic drugs sometimes need to be taken\\nwith other medications. For example, steroids such as\\nprednisone are also prescribed together with the anti-\\nhelminthic drug for tapeworm to reduce the inflam-\\nmation that the worm may cause.\\n308 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAntihelminthic drugs'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 338, 'page_label': '339'}, page_content='When required, pre- or post-treatment purges are\\nalso performed with magnesium or sodium sulfate.\\nRegular medical visits are recommended for peo-\\nple affected by parasitic infestations.

Check with a pharma-\\ncist for a list of drugs that may interact with specific\\nantihemorrhoid drugs.\\nNancy Ross-Flanigan\\nAntihistamines\\nDefinition\\nAntihistamines are drugs that block the action of\\nhistamine (a compound released in allergic inflamma-\\ntory reactions) at the H1 receptor sites, responsible for\\nimmediate hypersensitivity reactions such as sneezing\\nanditching. Members of this class of drugs may also be\\nused for their side effects, includingsedation and anti-\\nemesis (prevention ofnausea and vomiting).\\nPurpose\\nAntihistamines provide their primary action by\\nblocking histamine H1 at the receptor site. They have\\nno effect on rate of histamine release, nor do they\\ninactivate histamine. By inhibiting the activity of\\nhistamine, they can reduce capillary fragility, which\\nproduces the erythema, or redness, associated with\\nallergic reactions. They will also reduce histamine-\\ninduced secretions, including excessive tears and\\nsalivation. Additional effects vary with the indivi-\\ndual drug used. Several of the older drugs, called\\nfirst-generation antihistamines, bind non-selectively\\nto H1 receptors in the central nervous system as\\nwell as to peripheral receptors, and can produce\\nsedation, inhibition of nausea and vomiting,a n d\\nreduction ofmotion sickness.

Although uric acid levels must be\\nhigh in order for patients to have crystals form, and\\ntherefore have gout, most persons with high uric acid\\nlevels don’t ever have symptoms. Thus, recent criteria\\nfor use of anti-hyperuricemic agents suggest that\\npatients who have never experienced symptoms of\\ngout should not receive drug therapy, unless their\\nhyperuricemia is associated withcancer (may lead to\\nkidney damage) or certain rare genetic disorders\\n(McGill, Rheumatologist, University of Sydney,\\nAustralia, 2000).\\nAcute gout attacks\\nWhen patients experience acute attacks of\\ngout, drugs that lower the levels of uric acid can\\ncause an acute gout attack or cause an attack to\\nbecome more severe. Thus, drugs that lower uric\\nacid levels and are used to treat gout in the long\\nterm are not used in the short term. Medications\\nused in acute gout attacks include non-steroidal\\nanti-inflammatory drugs (such as indomethacin),\\ncolchicine, andcorticosteroids . Colchicine causes\\nside effects in a large number of individuals\\n(usually diarhhea). The most important factor in\\nthe effective treatment of gout may not be the drug\\nused, but how quickly it is administered after an\\nacute attack has begun.\\nLong-term treatment\\nLong-term treatment of gout or hyperuricemia\\nusually involves one of four drugs: allopurinol,\\nprobenicid, sulphinpyrazone, or benzbromarone\\n(as of 2001, benzbromarone was not available for\\nuse in the United States). While allopurinol\\ndecreases the amount of uric acid that is produced\\n(and may help prevent acute attacks of gout), the\\nother drugs all increase the rate at which uric acid\\nis excreted in the urine. As previously mentioned,\\nlowering the concentration of uric acid can cause\\ngout attacks. Thus, patients taking these medica-\\ntions should have the dose slowly increased (and\\nuric acid levels slowly lowered) to prevent acute\\nattacks of gout. Patients may also be treated with\\ncolchicine or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory\\ndrugs to prevent acute attacks of gout (corticoster-\\noids are not used in this scenario because over the\\nlong term corticosteroids have deleterious side\\neffects). In 2004, the FDA was seeking trial data\\non a new drug called oxypurinol (Oxyprim) for\\ntreating chronic gout.

These drugs\\nshould be used only for occasional treatment of tempor-\\narysleepproblemsandshouldnotbetakenformorethan\\na week or two at a time. People whose sleep problems last\\nlonger than this should see a physician. Their sleep pro-\\nblems could be a sign of another medical problem.\\nDescription\\nThe anti-insomnia drug described here, zolpidem\\n(Ambien), is a classified as a central nervous system\\n(CNS) depressant. CNS depressants are medicines\\nthat slow the nervous system. Physicians also prescribe\\nmedicines in the benzodiazepine family, such as flura-\\nzepam (Dalmane), quazepam (Doral), triazolam\\n(Halcion), estazolam (ProSom), and temazepam\\n(Restoril), forinsomnia. Benzodiazepine drugs are\\ndescribed in the essay onantianxiety drugs. Zaleplon\\n(Sonata) is another anti-insomnia drug that is not\\nrelated to other drugs with the same effect. Thebarbi-\\nturates, such as pentobarbital (Nembutal) and secobar-\\nbital (Seconal) are no longer commonly used to treat\\ninsomnia because they are too dangerous if they are\\ntaken in overdoses. For patients with mild insomnia,\\nsomeantihistamines, such as diphenhydramine\\n(Benadryl) or hydroxyzine (Atarax) may be used,\\nsince these also cause sleepiness.\\nZolpidem is available only with a physician’s\\nprescription and comes in tablet form.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 317\\nAnti-insomnia drugs'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 347, 'page_label': '348'}, page_content='Recommended dosage\\nThe recommended dose for adults is 5-10 mg just\\nbefore bedtime.

The disease\\nis caused by a parasite,Plasmodium, which belongs\\nto a group of one-celled organisms known as proto-\\nzoa. The only way to get malaria is to be bitten by a\\ncertain type of mosquito that has bitten someone\\nwho has the disease. Thanks to mosquito control\\nprograms, malaria has been eliminated in the\\nUnited States, almost all of Europe, and large\\nparts of Central and South America. However, mos-\\nquito control has not worked well in other parts\\nof the world, and malaria continues to be a\\nmajor health problem in parts of Africa, Southeast\\nAsia, Latin America, Haiti, the Dominican Republic,\\nand some Pacific Islands. Every year, some\\n30,000 Americans and Europeans who travel to\\nthese areas get malaria. People planning to travel to\\nthe tropics are often advised to take antimalarial\\ndrugs before, during, and after their trips, to help\\nthem avoid getting the disease and bringing it home\\nwith them. These drugs killPlasmodium or prevent\\nits growth.\\nIn recent years, some strains of Plasmodium\\nhave become resistant to antimalarial drugs, and\\nmedical researchers have stepped up efforts to\\ndevelop a malaria vaccine. In early 1997, research-\\ners reported encouraging results from a small study\\nof one vaccine and planned to test the vaccine\\nin Africa.\\nKEY TERMS\\nGlucose— A simple sugar that serves as the body’s\\nmain source of energy.\\nHypoglycemia— Abnormally low levels of glucose\\nin the blood.\\nOrganism— An individual of some type of life form,\\nsuch as a plant or an animal.\\nParasite— An organism that lives and feeds in or on\\nanother organism (the host) and does nothing to\\nbenefit the host.\\nProtozoa— Animal-like, one-celled organisms,\\nsome of which cause diseases in people.\\nPsoriasis— A skin disease in which people have\\nitchy, scaly, red patches on the skin.\\nPurpura— A spotty or patchy purplish rash caused\\nby bleeding under the surface of the skin.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 321\\nAntimalarial drugs'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 351, 'page_label': '352'}, page_content='Description\\nAntimalarial drugs are available only with a phy-\\nsician’s prescription.

Odle\\nAntimicrobial agents see Antibiotics\\nAntimigraine drugs\\nDefinition\\nAntimigraine drugs are medicines used to prevent\\nor reduce the severity of migraine headaches.\\nPurpose\\nMigraine headaches usually cause a throbbing\\npain on one side of the head.Nausea, vomiting, dizzi-\\nness, increased sensitivity to light and sound, and\\nother symptoms may accompany the pain. The attacks\\nmay last for several hours or for a day or more and\\nmay come as often as several times a week. Some\\npeople who get migraine headaches have warning sig-\\nnals before the headaches begin, such as restlessness,\\ntinglingin an arm or leg, or seeing patterns of flashing\\nlights. This set of signals is called an aura. The anti-\\nmigraine drugs discussed in this section are meant to\\nbe taken as soon as the pain begins, to relieve the pain\\nand other symptoms. Other types of drugs, such as\\nantiseizure medicines, antidepressants,calcium chan-\\nnel blockers and beta blockers, are sometimes pre-\\nscribed to prevent attacks in people with very severe\\nor frequent migraines.\\nDescription\\nMigraine is thought to be caused by electrical and\\nchemical imbalances in certain parts of the brain.\\nThese imbalances affect the blood vessels in the\\nbrain – first tightening them up, then widening them.\\nAs the blood vessels widen, they stimulate the release\\nof chemicals that increase sensitivity to pain and cause\\ninflammation and swelling. Antimigraine drugs are\\nbelieved to work by correcting the imbalances and by\\ntightening the blood vessels.\\nExamples of drugs in this group are ergotamine\\n(Cafergot), naratriptan (Amerge), sumatriptan\\n(Imitrex), rizatriptan (Maxalt), almotriptan (Axert),\\nand zolmitriptan (Zomig). Methysergide maleate\\n(Sansert) may be used by patients whose headaches\\nare not controlled by other drugs, while some patients\\ndo well on other drugs. For example, combinations\\nor ergotamine and caffeine may be very effective.\\nThe caffeine acts by constricting blood vessels to\\nrelieve the headache. Sometimes, an analgesic such\\nas acetaminophen, caffeine, and a barbiturate which\\nacts as a sedative, are combined, as in Fioricet and\\nsimilar compounds. These medicines are available\\nonly with a physician’s prescription and come in\\nseveral forms. Ergotamine is available as tablets\\n324 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAntimigraine drugs'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 354, 'page_label': '355'}, page_content='and rectal suppositories; sumatriptan as tablets,\\ninjections, and nasal spray; and zolmitriptan as\\ntablets.\\nAntimigraine drugs are used to treat headaches\\nonce they have started.

Patients\\nshould not use them for other headaches, such as those\\ncaused bystress or too much alcohol, unless directed\\nto do so by a physician.\\nAnyone whose headache is unlike any previous\\nheadache should check with a physician before taking\\nthese drugs. If the headache is far worse than any\\nother, emergency medical treatment should be sought\\nimmediately.\\nTaking too much of the antimigraine drug ergota-\\nmine (Cafergot), can lead to ergotpoisoning. Symptoms\\ninclude headache, muscle pain,numbness, coldness, and\\nunusually pale fingers and toes.

These drugs should not be\\ntaken within 24 hours of taking any drug containing\\nergotamine.\\nSome antimigraine drugs work by tightening\\nblood vessels in the brain. Because these drugs also\\naffect blood vessels in other parts of the body, people\\nwith coronary heart disease, circulatory problems, or\\nhigh blood pressure should not take these medicines\\nunless directed to do so by their physicians.\\nAbout 40% of all migraine attacks do not\\nrespond to treatment with triptans or any other\\nmedication. If the headache lasts longer than 72\\nhours—a condition known as status migrainosus—\\nthe patient may be given narcotic medications to\\nbring on sleep and stop the attack. Patients with\\nstatus migrainosus are often hospitalized because\\nthey are likely to be dehydrated from severenausea\\nand vomiting.\\nSpecial conditions\\nPeople with certain other medical conditions or\\nwho are taking certain other medicines can have pro-\\nblems if they take antimigraine drugs. Before taking\\nthese drugs, be sure to let the physician know about\\nany of these conditions:\\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reac-\\ntions to ergotamine, caffeine, sumatriptan, zolmitrip-\\ntan, or other antimigraine drugs in the past should let\\nhis or her physician know before taking the drugs\\nagain. The physician should also be told about any\\nallergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other\\nsubstances.\\nPREGNANCY. Women who are pregnant should\\nnot take ergotamine (Cafergot). The effects of other\\nantimigraine drugs duringpregnancy have not been\\nwell studied. Any woman who is pregnant or plans to\\nbecome pregnant should let her physician know before\\nan antimigraine drug is prescribed.\\nBREASTFEEDING. Some antimigraine drugs can\\npass into breast milk and may cause serious problems\\nin nursing babies. Women who are breastfeeding\\nshould check with their physicians about whether to\\nstop breastfeeding while taking the medicine.\\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS.

Autoantibodies are also proteins built by the body,\\nbut instead of attacking foreign material, they inappro-\\npriatelyattackthebody’s owncells. Antimyocardial anti-\\nbodies attack a person’s heart muscle, or myocardium.\\nThis test may be done on a person who recently\\nhad trauma to the heart, such as heart surgery or a\\nmyocardial infarction (heart attack). It also may be\\ndone on someone with heart disease, such ascardio-\\nmyopathy or rheumatic fever.\\nAlthough the presence of antimyocardial antibo-\\ndies does not diagnose heart damage or disease, there is\\na connection between the presence of these antibodies\\nand damage to the heart. The amount of damage, how-\\never, cannot be predicted by the amount of antibodies.\\nThese antibodies usually appear after heart surgery\\northebeginningofdisease,buttheymaybepresentbefore\\nsurgery or the onset of disease. In 30% of people with\\nmyocardial infarction and 70% of people having heart\\nsurgery, antimyocardial antibodies will appear within\\ntwo to three weeks and stay for three to eight weeks.\\nDescription\\nA 5-10 mL sample of venous blood is drawn from\\nthe patient’s arm in the region of the inner elbow.\\nAntimyocardial antibodies are detected by combining\\na patient’s serum (clear, thin, sticky fluid in blood)\\nwith cells from animal heart tissue, usually that of a\\nmonkey. Antimyocardial antibodies in the serum bind\\nto the heart tissue cells. A fluorescent dye is then added\\nto the mixture. This dye will attach to any antibodies\\nand heart tissue cells bound together. The final mix-\\nture is studied under a microscope that is designed to\\nshow fluorescence. If fluorescent cells are seen under\\nthe microscope, the test is positive.\\nWhen the test is positive, the next step is to find\\nout how much antibody is present. The patient’s\\nserum is diluted, or titered, and the test is done\\nagain. The serum is then further diluted and the test\\nrepeated until the serum is so dilute that fluorescence is\\nno longer seen. The last dilution that showed fluores-\\ncence is the titer reported.\\nPreparation\\nNo fasting or special prepartion is needed. Before\\nthe test is done it should be explained to the patient.\\nAftercare\\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\\nsite after the blood is drawn or the person may feel\\ndizzy or faint. Pressure to the puncture site until the\\nbleeding stops reduces bruising. Warm packs on the\\npuncture site relieve discomfort.\\nNormal results\\nAntimyocardial antibodies are not normally seen\\nin healthy individuals.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAntibody— A special protein built by the body as\\na defense against foreign material entering the\\nbody.\\nAntimyocardial antibody— An autoantibody that\\nattacks a person’s own heart muscle, or\\nmyocardium.\\nAutoantibody— An antibody that attacks the\\nbody’s own cells or tissues.\\nMyocardial infarction— A block in the blood sup-\\nply to the heart, resulting in what is commonly\\ncalled a heart attack.\\nMyocardium— The muscular middle layer of the\\nheart.\\nTiter— A dilution of a substance with an exact\\nknown amount of fluid.

Odle\\nAntinuclear antibody test\\nDefinition\\nThe antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is a test done\\nearly in the evaluation of a person for autoimmune or\\nrheumatic disease, particularlysystemic lupus erythe-\\nmatosus (SLE).\\nPurpose\\nIn autoimmune diseases, the body makes antibo-\\ndies that work against its own cells or tissues.\\nRheumatic diseases (diseases that affect connective\\ntissue, including the joints, bone, and muscle) are\\nalso associated with these antibodies. Autoantibodies\\nare proteins built by the body, but instead of guarding\\nagainst foreign material (including bacteria, viruses,\\nand fungi) as normal antibodies do, they attack the\\nbody’s own cells.\\nAutoimmune and rheumatic diseases can be diffi-\\ncult to diagnose. People with the same disease can\\nhave very different symptoms. A helpful strategy in\\nthe diagnosis of these diseases is to find and identify an\\nautoantibody in the person’s blood.\\nThe antinuclear antibody test looks for a\\ngroup of autoantibodies that attack substances\\nfound in the center (nucleus) of all cells. It is useful\\nas a screen for many autoantibodies associated\\nwith diseases that affect the entire body (systemic\\ndiseases).\\nThis test is particularly useful when diagnosing a\\nperson with symptoms of SLE, an illness that affects\\nmany body organs and tissues. If the test is negative, it\\nis unlikely that the person has SLE; if the test is positive,\\nmore tests are done to confirm whether the person has\\nSLE or another related disease. Other diseases, such as\\nscleroderma, Sjo¨gren’s syndrome, Raynaud’s disease,\\nrheumatoid arthritis,a n dautoimmune hepatitis, often\\nhave a positive test for antinuclear antibodies.\\nDescription\\nFive to 10 mL of blood is needed for this test. The\\nantinuclear antibody test is done by adding a person’s\\nserum to commercial cells mounted on a microscope\\nslide. If antinuclear antibodies are in the serum, they\\nbind to the nuclei of cells on the slide. Next, a second\\nantibody is added to the mixture. This antibody is\\n‘‘tagged’’ with a fluorescent dye so that it can be\\nseen. The second antibody attaches to any antibodies\\nand cells bound together and, because of the fluores-\\ncent ‘‘tag,’’ the areas with antinuclear antibodies seem\\nto glow, or fluoresce, when the slide is viewed under an\\nultraviolet microscope.\\nIf fluorescent cells are seen, the test is positive.\\nWhen positive, the serum is diluted, or titered, and\\nthe test done again. These steps are repeated until the\\nserum is so dilute it no longer gives a positive result.\\nThe last dilution that shows fluorescence is the titer\\nreported.\\nThe pattern of fluorescence within the cells gives\\nthe physician clues as to what the disease might be.\\nThe test result includes the titer and the pattern.\\nThis test is also called the fluorescent antinuclear\\nantibody test or FANA. Results are available within\\none to three days.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAntibody— A special protein built by the immune\\nsystem as a defense against foreign material enter-\\ning the body.\\nAutoantibody— An antibody that attacks the body’s\\nown cells or tissues.\\nAntinuclear antibodies—Autoantibodies that attack\\nsubstances found in the center, or nucleus, of all\\ncells.\\nAutoimmune disease— Disease in which the body\\nmakes antibodies against its own cells or tissues.\\nTiter— A dilution of a substance with an exact\\nknown amount of fluid.

Nordenson\\nAntiparkinson drugs\\nDefinition\\nAntiparkinson drugs are medicines that relieve the\\nsymptoms of Parkinson’s disease and other forms of\\nparkinsonism.\\nPurpose\\nAntiparkinson drugs are used to treat symptoms of\\nparkinsonism, a group of disorders that share four\\nmain symptoms: tremor or trembling in the hands,\\narms, legs, jaw, and face; stiffness or rigidity of the\\narms, legs, and trunk; slowness of movement (bradyki-\\nnesia); and poor balance and coordination. Parkinson’s\\ndisease is the most common form of parkinsonism and\\nis seen more frequently with advancing age.

Drug therapy may\\ntake several forms, including replacement of dopa-\\nmine, inhibition of dopamine metabolism to increase\\nthe effects of the dopamine already present, or sensi-\\ntization of dopamine receptors. Drugs may be used\\nsingly or in combination.\\nDescription\\nLevodopa (Larodopa) is the mainstay of\\nParkinson’s treatment. The drug crosses the blood-\\nbrain barrier, and is converted to dopamine. The drug\\nmay be administered alone, or in combination with\\ncarbidopa (Lodosyn) which inhibits the enzyme respon-\\nsible for the destruction of levodopa. The limitation of\\nlevodopa or levodopa-carbidopa therapy is that after\\napproximately two years of treatment, the drugs cease\\nto work reliably. This has been termed the ‘‘on-off phe-\\nnomenon.’’ Additional treatment strategies have been\\ndeveloped to retard the progression of Parkinsonism,\\nor to find alternative approaches to treatment.\\nAnticholinergic drugs reduce some of the symp-\\ntoms of Parkinsonism, and reduce the reuptake of\\ndopamine, thereby sustaining the activity of the nat-\\nural neurohormone.

Uretsky, PharmD\\nAnti-rejection drugs\\nDefinition\\nAnti-rejection drugs are daily medications taken by\\norgan transplant patients to prevent organ rejection.\\nPurpose\\nAnti-rejection drugs, which are also called immuno-\\nsuppressants, help to suppress the immune system’s\\nresponse to a new organ. When a new organ is placed\\ninside a patient s body, the patient’s immune system\\nrecognizes the organ as foreign tissue and tries to reject it.\\nDescription\\nWhen a physician prescribes anti-rejection drugs,\\nthe patient’s risk of rejection and susceptibility to side\\neffects are considered. The most common drugs pre-\\nscribed to prevent organ rejection are cyclosporine,\\nprednisone, azathioprine, tacrolimus or FK506,\\nmycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus, and OKT3, as well\\nas ATGAM and Thymoglobulin. As is true with all\\nmedications, each of these drugs has benefits and\\ndrawbacks. Cyclosporine, which is one of the most\\nfrequently used anti-rejection drugs, is usually com-\\nbined with prednisone. An extremely powerful medi-\\ncine, cyclosporine is usually taken by a patient over the\\ncourse of his or her lifetime. Cortisol, which is the\\nnaturally produced form of prednisone in a person’s\\nbody, helps the body managestress, such as infections\\nor organ rejection. Taking prednisone results in less\\ncortisol production in a person’s body, thus minimizing\\nthe risk of rejection. Azathioprine, which needs to be\\ntaken with food to avoid stomach upset, is frequently\\ncombined with cyclosporine, prednisone, or tacrolimus.\\nMycophenolate mofetil is a relatively new immunosup-\\npressant that is similar to azathioprine; therefore, the\\ntwo drugs should not be taken together. It is preferable\\nto take mycophenolate mofetil on an empty stomach;\\nhowever, like azathioprine, it can be taken with food\\nbecause it, too, can cause stomach problems, such as\\nheartburn and nausea. Like azathioprine, mycopheno-\\nlate mofetil is not a stand-alone drug; instead, it must be\\nused, in combination with other medications. This is\\nalso the case with regard to sirolimus.\\nPhysicians prescribe either mycophenolate mofetil\\nor azathioprine (in combination with otherimmuno-\\nsuppressant drugs) to help patients cope with acute\\nbouts of organ rejection. The medications work by\\ninterfering with the multiplication process of white\\nblood cells, which is part of the body’s natural defense\\n340 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAnti-rejection drugs'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 370, 'page_label': '371'}, page_content='system when foreign invaders, such as a new organ, are\\ndetected. However, researchers at Duke University\\nand the University of Florida found that mycopheno-\\nlate mofetil doesn’t work any better than azathioprine,\\nbut costs significantly more. Aside from cost, another\\nconsideration also needs to be the type of organ trans-\\nplanted, because acute rejection rates differ. For\\nexample, six months after surgery, approximately\\n15% of kidney recipients will have an acute rejection\\nepisode as compared to approximately 60% of lung\\nrecipients. And because study results vary depending\\non the organ transplanted, more research is needed\\nwith regard to the success of mycophenolate mofetil as\\ncompared to azathioprine.\\nOKT3 prevents is prescribed to prevent organ rejec-\\ntion immediately after surgery and is also used to treat\\nacute rejection episodes; ATGAM and Thymoglobulin,\\nwhich are similar to OKT3, are used for the same rea-\\nsons. All three drugs are given intravenously.\\nTacrolimus, which is also known as FK506, is a\\nfairly new drug that is considered by many experts to\\nbe as effective as cyclosporine. An alternative drug\\nchoice for patients that cannot tolerate cyclosporine,\\ntacrolimus has been the subject of much research in\\nrecent years. Used to treat rejection episodes that are\\nacute or chronic in nature, tacrolimus is being studied\\nto see if using it will allow patients to reduce their\\ndosage of prednisone without organ rejection.\\nIn a presentation at the 2003 American\\nTransplant Congress, surgeons from the University\\nof Pittsburgh reported that an innovative clinical pro-\\ntocol developed by Dr. Thomas E. Starzl was imple-\\nmented, which reduced the dosage of tacrolimus\\nneeded by lung transplant patients with excellent suc-\\ncess. Patients required lower doses of prednisone as\\nwell. In fact, in some cases, patients were taking tacro-\\nlimus only once a day (rather than twice a day) or only\\nfour times a week. Over the long-term, physicians\\nhope that there will be less risk of lung recipients\\ndeveloping the kinds of complications normally asso-\\nciated with high levels of immunosuppressants, such\\nas kidney dysfunction, which is a common problem\\nfaced by lung transplant patients.\\nDr. Thomas E. Strazl, the renowned physician\\noften referred to as the modern-day father of transplan-\\ntation, developed the protocol based on the knowledge\\nthat some of his patients had stopped taking their daily\\npills with no ill effects. Starzl theorized that giving sev-\\neral drugs to a patient immediately after surgery, which\\nwas the normal practice, might inhibit the immune sys-\\ntem from developing a tolerance for the new organ.\\nTherefore, his new protocol embraced a different\\napproach. Shortly before the transplantation, patients\\nwere given a drug that killed their T-cells and after the\\noperation, patients received only one anti-rejection\\nmedicine rather than the multi-pill cocktail normally\\nprescribed. In an article published byLancet in 2003,\\nStarzl and colleagues reported the results of their pilot\\nstudy involving 82 two kidney, liver, pancreas or small\\nbowel transplant patients treated according to the new\\ndrug protocol. Out of the 72 patients with successful\\ntransplants after one year, over half the patients were\\ntaking anti-rejection medication either every other day,\\nthree times per week or twice per week. Amazingly, 11 of\\nthe patients were taking only one pill a week and they\\nexhibited no signs of organ rejection or complications.\\nCertainly more research needs to be conducted, but\\nthese results are very promising.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe dosages vary depending on the drug or drug\\ncombination being taken by the patient. In general,\\ncyclosporine is taken every 12 hours in liquid or capsule\\nform. Tacrolimus is generally taken every 12 hours as\\nw e l l .T h el e v e lo fe i t h e rd r u gi nap a t i e n t ’ sb l o o di s\\nmonitored carefully and doses are adjusted accordingly\\nin order to not only prevent reject, but also unpleasant\\nside effects. Azathioprine is taken once a day in tablet\\nform, whereas mycophenolate mofetil is generally taken\\nevery 12 hours. High doses of prednisone are usually\\ngiven at first and then tapered down slowly.\\nPrecautions\\nPatients should discuss proper storage methods\\nwith regard to their medications. Sirolimus, for exam-\\nple, should be stored at room temperature with special\\ncare taken to keep it out of excessive heat and humidity.\\nAlthough pregnant women taking anti-rejection\\ndrugs have delivered healthy babies, women planning\\non becoming pregnant while taking anti-rejection\\ndrugs should talk with their physicians regarding any\\npossible complications. For example, the safety of\\ntaking mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy or\\nwhile breastfeeding is questionable and not advised.\\nSide effects\\nSide effects vary depending on the individual and\\nthe drug therapy chosen. Patients should talk with\\ntheir doctors regarding the various side effects they\\ncan expect and under what conditions emergency\\nmedical care needs to be sought.\\nInteractions\\nIt is essential that patients talk with their pharma-\\ncist and transplant team before taking any medications,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 341\\nAnti-rejection drugs'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 371, 'page_label': '372'}, page_content='regardless of whether they are prescription or over-the-\\ncounter drugs to ensure that the combinations will\\nnot interact.

The best known of this group is HIV, human\\nimmunodeficiencyvirus, the causative agent ofAIDS.\\nPurpose\\nAntiretroviral agents are virustatic agents which\\nblock steps in the replication of the virus. The drugs\\nare not curative; however continued use of drugs,\\nparticularly in multi-drug regimens, significantly\\nslows disease progression.\\nDescription\\nThere are three main types of antiretroviral drugs,\\nalthough only two steps in the viral replication process\\nare blocked. Nucleoside analogs, or nucleoside reverse\\ntranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), such as didanosine\\n(ddI, Videx), lamivudine (3TC, Epivir), stavudine\\n(d4T, Zerit), zalcitabine (ddC, Hivid), and zidovudine\\n(AZT, Retrovir), act by inhibiting the enzyme reverse\\ntranscriptase. Because a retrovirus is composed of\\nRNA, the virus must make a DNA strand in order to\\nreplicate itself. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that\\nis essential to making the DNA copy. The nucleoside\\nreverse transcriptase inhibitors are incorporated into\\nthe DNA strand. This is a faulty DNA molecule that is\\nincapable of reproducing.\\nThe non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors\\n(NNRTIs), such as delavirdine (Rescriptor), loviride,\\nand nevirapine (Viramune) act by binding directly to\\nthe reverse transcriptase molecule, inhibiting its\\nactivity.\\nA fourth class of drugs was under clinical trials in\\n2003. Called fusion inhibitors, they block HIV from\\nfusing with healthy cells. The first to receive FDA\\napproval will likely be a drug called Enfurvitide.\\nBecause HIV mutates readily, the virus can\\ndevelop resistance to single drug therapy. However,\\ntreatment with drug combinations appears to produce\\na durable response. Proper treatment appears to\\nslow the progression of HIV infections and reduce\\nthe frequency of opportunistic infections. One of the\\nmost notable advances in recent years has been the\\nsuccess of highly active antiretroviral therapy\\n(HAART). This multidrug approach reduced the\\nrisk of opportunistic infections in persons with HIV/\\nAIDS and slowed the progression of the disease and\\ndeath. Usually, patients receive triple combination\\ntherapy, however research in 2003 showed a new\\nonce-daily regimen of quadruple therapy effective.\\nThe combination included adefovir, lamivudine,\\ndidanosine, and efavirenz. In short, the scientific com-\\nmunity continues to make rapid advancements in\\ndeveloping and evaluating antiretroviral drug therapy.\\nIt is best to keep well informed and frequently check\\nwith a physician.\\n342 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAntiretroviral drugs'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 372, 'page_label': '373'}, page_content='Recommended dosage\\nDoses must be individualized based on the patient\\nand use of interacting drugs.

It is most com-\\nmon in areas of crowding and poor ventilation, suich as\\ncrowded urban areas and prisons. In some areas, the\\nAIDS epidemic has been accompanied by an increase\\nin the prevalence of tuberculosis.\\nSome antituberculosis drugs also are used to treat\\nor prevent other infections such asMycobacterium\\navium complex (MAC), which causes disease through-\\nout the bodies of people with AIDS or other diseases\\nof the immune system.\\nDescription\\nAntituberculosis drugs are available only with a\\nphysician’s prescription and come in tablet, capsule,\\nliquid and injectable forms. Some commonly used\\nantituberculosis drugs are cycloserine (Seromycin),\\nethambutol (Myambutol), ethionamide (Trecator-\\nSC), isoniazid (Nydrazid, Laniazid), pyrazinamide,\\nrifabutin (Mycobutin), and rifampin (Rifadin,\\nRimactane).\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nantituberculosis drug and may be different for differ-\\nent patients.

Uretsky, PharmD\\nAnxiety\\nDefinition\\nAnxiety is a multisystem response to a perceived\\nthreat or danger. It reflects a combination of biochem-\\nical changes in the body, the patient’s personal history\\nand memory, and the social situation. As far as we\\nknow, anxiety is a uniquely human experience. Other\\nanimals clearly know fear, but human anxiety involves\\nan ability, to use memory and imagination to move\\nbackward and forward in time, that animals do\\nnot appear to have. The anxiety that occurs in post-\\ntraumatic syndromes indicates that human memory is\\na much more complicated mental function than ani-\\nmal memory. Moreover, a large portion of human\\nanxiety is produced by anticipation of future events.\\nWithout a sense of personal continuity over time,\\npeople would not have the ‘‘raw materials’’ of anxiety.\\nIt is important to distinguish between anxiety as a\\nfeeling or experience, and an anxiety disorder as a\\npsychiatric diagnosis. A person may feel anxious with-\\nout having an anxiety disorder. In addition, a person\\nfacing a clear and present danger or a realistic fear is\\nnot usually considered to be in a state of anxiety. In\\naddition, anxiety frequently occurs as a symptom in\\nother categories of psychiatric disturbance.\\nDescription\\nAlthough anxiety is a commonplace experience\\nthat everyone has from time to time, it is difficult to\\ndescribe concretely because it has so many different\\npotential causes and degrees of intensity. Doctors\\nsometimes categorize anxiety as an emotion or an\\naffect depending on whether it is being described by\\nthe person having it (emotion) or by an outside obser-\\nver (affect). The wordemotion is generally used for the\\nbiochemical changes and feeling state that underlie a\\nperson’s internal sense of anxiety.Affect is used to\\ndescribe the person’s emotional state from an obser-\\nver’s perspective. If a doctor says that a patient has an\\nanxious affect, he or she means that the patient\\nappears nervous or anxious, or responds to others in\\nan anxious way (for example, the individual is shaky,\\ntremulous, etc.).\\nAlthough anxiety is related to fear, it is not the\\nsame thing. Fear is a direct, focused response to a\\nspecific event or object, and the person is consciously\\naware of it. Most people will feel fear if someone\\npoints a loaded gun at them or if they see a tornado\\nforming on the horizon. They also will recognize that\\nthey are afraid. Anxiety, on the other hand, is often\\nunfocused, vague, and hard to pin down to a specific\\ncause. In this form it is called free-floating anxiety.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAffect— An observed emotional expression or\\nresponse. In some situations, anxiety would be\\nconsidered an inappropriate affect.\\nAnxiolytic— A type of medication that helps to\\nrelieve anxiety.\\nAutonomic nervous system (ANS)— The part of the\\nnervous system that supplies nerve endings in the\\nblood vessels, heart, intestines, glands, and smooth\\nmuscles, and governs their involuntary functioning.\\nThe autonomic nervous system is responsible for\\nthe biochemical changes involved in experiences\\nof anxiety.\\nEndocrine gland— A ductless gland, such as the\\npituitary, thyroid, or adrenal gland, that secretes\\nits products directly into the blood or lymph.\\nFree-floating anxiety— Anxiety that lacks a definite\\nfocus or content.\\nHyperarousal— A state or condition of muscular\\nand emotional tension produced by hormones\\nreleased during the fight-or-flight reaction.\\nHypothalamus— A portion of the brain that regu-\\nlates the autonomic nervous system, the release of\\nhormones from the pituitary gland, sleep cycles,\\nand body temperature.\\nLimbic system— A group of structures in the brain\\nthat includes the hypothalamus, amygdala, and\\nhippocampus. The limbic system plays an impor-\\ntant part in regulation of human moods and emo-\\ntions. Many psychiatric disorders are related to\\nmalfunctioning of the limbic system.\\nPhobia— In psychoanalytic theory, a psychological\\ndefense against anxiety in which the patient dis-\\nplaces anxious feelings onto an external object,\\nactivity, or situation.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 357\\nAnxiety'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 387, 'page_label': '388'}, page_content='Sometimes anxiety being experienced in the present\\nmay stem from an event or person that produced\\npain and fear in the past, but the anxious individual\\nis not consciously aware of the original source of the\\nfeeling. It is anxiety’s aspect of remoteness that makes\\nit hard for people to compare their experiences of it.\\nWhereas most people will be fearful in physically dan-\\ngerous situations, and can agree that fear is an appro-\\npriate response in the presence of danger, anxiety is\\noften triggered by objects or events that are unique\\nand specific to an individual. An individual might be\\nanxious because of a unique meaning or memory\\nbeing stimulated by present circumstances, not\\nbecause of some immediate danger. Another indivi-\\ndual looking at the anxious person from the outside\\nmay be truly puzzled as to the reason for the person’s\\nanxiety.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnxiety can have a number of different causes. It is\\na multidimensional response to stimuli in the person’s\\nenvironment, or a response to an internal stimulus (for\\nexample, a hypochondriac’s reaction to a stomach\\nrumbling) resulting from a combination of general\\nbiological and individual psychological processes.\\nPhysical\\nIn some cases, anxiety is produced by physical\\nresponses tostress, or by certain disease processes or\\nmedications.\\nTHE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (ANS).The ner-\\nvous system of human beings is ‘‘hard-wired’’ to\\nrespond to dangers or threats. These responses are\\nnot subject to conscious control, and are the same in\\nhumans as in lower animals. They represent an evolu-\\ntionary adaptation to the animal predators and other\\ndangers with which all animals, including primitive\\nhumans, had to cope. The most familiar reaction of\\nthis type is the so-called ‘‘fight-or-flight’’ response.\\nThis response is the human organism’s automatic\\n‘‘red alert’’ in a life-threatening situation. It is a state\\nof physiological and emotional hyperarousal marked\\nby high muscle tension and strong feelings of fear or\\nanger. When a person has a fight-or-flight reaction,\\nthe level of stress hormones in their blood rises. They\\nbecome more alert and attentive, their eyes dilate, their\\nheartbeat increases, their breathing rate increases, and\\ntheir digestion slows down, allowing more energy to be\\navailable to the muscles.\\nThis emergency reaction is regulated by a part\\nof the nervous system called the autonomic nervous\\nsystem, or ANS. The ANS is controlled by the\\nhypothalamus, a specialized part of the brainstem\\nthat is among a group of structures called the limbic\\nsystem. The limbic system controls human emotions\\nthrough its connections to glands and muscles; it also\\nconnects to the ANS and ‘‘higher’’ brain centers, such\\nas parts of the cerebral cortex. One problem with this\\narrangement is that the limbic system cannot tell the\\ndifference between a realistic physical threat and an\\nanxiety-producing thought or idea. The hypothalamus\\nmay trigger the release of stress hormones by the\\npituitary gland, even when there is no external and\\nobjective danger. A second problem is caused by the\\nbiochemical side effects of too many ‘‘false alarms’’ in\\nthe ANS. When a person responds to a real danger,\\nhis or her body gets rid of the stress hormones by\\nrunning away or by fighting. In modern life, however,\\npeople often have fight-or-flight reactions in situations\\nin which they can neither run away nor lash out\\nphysically. As a result, their bodies have to absorb all\\nthe biochemical changes of hyperarousal, rather\\nthan release them. These biochemical changes can\\nproduce anxious feelings, as well as muscle tension\\nand other physical symptoms associated with anxiety.\\nThey may even produce permanent changes in the\\nbrain, if the process occurs repeatedly. Moreover,\\nchronic physical disorders, such as coronary artery\\ndisease, may be worsened by anxiety, as chronic\\nhyperarousal puts undue stress on the heart, stomach,\\nand other organs.\\nDISEASES AND DISORDERS. Anxiety can be a symp-\\ntom of certain medical conditions. Some of these dis-\\neases are disorders of the endocrine system, such as\\nCushing’s syndrome (overproduction of cortisol by\\nthe adrenal cortex), and include over- or underactivity\\nof the thyroid gland. Other medical conditions that\\ncan produce anxiety includerespiratory distress syn-\\ndrome, mitral valve prolapse, porphyria, and chest\\npain caused by inadequate blood supply to the heart\\n(angina pectoris).\\nA study released in 2004 showed that people who\\nhad experienced traumatic bone injuries may have\\nunrecognized anxiety in the form ofpost-traumatic\\nstress disorder. This disorder can result from witnes-\\nsing or experiencing an event involving serious injury,\\nor threatened death (or experiencing the death or\\nthreatened death of another.)\\nMEDICATIONS AND SUBSTANCE USE. Numerous\\nmedications may cause anxiety-like symptoms as a\\nside effect. They include birth control pills; some thyr-\\noid orasthma drugs; some psychotropic agents;\\noccasionally, local anesthetics;corticosteroids; antihy-\\npertensive drugs; and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\\ndrugs (like flurbiprofen and ibuprofen).\\n358 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAnxiety'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 388, 'page_label': '389'}, page_content='Although people do not usually think ofcaffeineas\\na drug, it can cause anxiety-like symptoms when con-\\nsumed in sufficient quantity. Patients who consume caf-\\nfeine rich foods and beverages, such as chocolate, cocoa,\\ncoffee, tea, or carbonated soft drinks (especially cola\\nbeverages), can sometimes lower their anxiety symptoms\\nsimply by reducing their intake of these substances.\\nWithdrawal from certain prescription drugs,\\nprimarily beta blockers and corticosteroids, can\\ncause anxiety. Withdrawal from drugs of abuse,\\nincluding LSD, cocaine, alcohol, and opiates, can\\nalso cause anxiety.\\nLearned associations\\nSome aspects of anxiety appear to be unavoidable\\nbyproducts of the human developmental process.\\nHumans are unique among animals in that they\\nspend an unusually long period of early life in a rela-\\ntively helpless condition, and a sense of helplessness\\ncan lead to anxiety. The extended period of human\\ndependency on adults means that people may remem-\\nber, and learn to anticipate, frightening or upsetting\\nexperiences long before they are capable enough to feel\\na sense of mastery over their environment. In addition,\\nthe fact that anxiety disorders often run in families\\nindicates that children can learn unhealthy attitudes\\nand behaviors from parents, as well as healthy ones.\\nAlso, recurrent disorders in families may indicate that\\nthere is a genetic or inherited component in some\\nanxiety disorders. For example, there has been found\\nto be a higher rate of anxiety disorders (panic) in\\nidentical twins than in fraternal twins.\\nCHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND ANXIETY.\\nResearchers in early childhood development regard\\nanxiety in adult life as a residue of childhood mem-\\nories of dependency. Humans learn during the first\\nyear of life that they are not self-sufficient and that\\ntheir basic survival depends on the care of others. It is\\nthought that this early experience of helplessness\\nunderlies the most common anxieties of adult life,\\nincluding fear of powerlessness and fear of being\\nunloved. Thus, adults can be made anxious by sym-\\nbolic threats to their sense of competence and/or\\nsignificant relationships, even though they are no\\nlonger helpless children.\\nSYMBOLIZATION. The psychoanalytic model gives\\nconsiderable weight to the symbolic aspect of human\\nanxiety; examples include phobic disorders, obsessions,\\ncompulsions, and other forms of anxiety that are highly\\nindividualized. The length of the human maturation\\nprocess allows many opportunities for children and\\nadolescents to connect their experiences with certain\\nobjects or events that can bring back feelings in later\\nlife. For example, a person who was frightened as a child\\nb yat a l lm a nw e a r i n gg l a s s e sm a yf e e lp a n i c k yy e a r s\\nlater by something that reminds him of that person or\\nexperience without consciously knowing why.\\nFreud thought that anxiety results from a per-\\nson’s internal conflicts. According to his theory,\\npeople feel anxious when they feel torn between\\ndesires or urges toward certain actions, on the one\\nhand, and moral restrictions, on the other. In some\\ncases, the person’s anxiety may attach itself to an\\nobject that represents the inner conflict. For exam-\\nple, someone who feels anxious around money may\\nbe pulled between a desire to steal and the belief that\\nstealing is wrong. Money becomes a symbol for the\\ninner conflict between doing what is considered right\\nand doing what one wants.\\nPHOBIAS. Phobias are a special type of anxiety\\nreaction in which the person’s anxiety is concentrated\\non a specific object or situation that the person then\\ntries to avoid. In most cases, the person’s fear is out of\\nall proportion to its ‘‘cause.’’ Prior to theDiagnostic\\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,4th edition\\n(DSM-IV), these specific phobias were called simple\\nphobias. It is estimated that 10-11% of the population\\nwill develop a phobia in the course of their lives. Some\\nphobias, such asagoraphobia (fear of open spaces),\\nclaustrophobia (fear of small or confined spaces), and\\nsocial phobia, are shared by large numbers of people.\\nOthers are less common or unique to the patient.\\nSocial and environmental stressors\\nAnxiety often has a social dimension because\\nhumans are social creatures. People frequently report\\nfeelings of high anxiety when they anticipate and,\\ntherefore, fear the loss of social approval or love.\\nSocial phobia is a specific anxiety disorder that is\\nmarked by high levels of anxiety or fear of embarrass-\\nment in social situations.\\nAnother social stressor is prejudice. People who\\nbelong to groups that are targets of bias are at higher\\nrisk for developing anxiety disorders. Some experts\\nthink, for example, that the higher rates of phobias\\nand panic disorderamong women reflects their greater\\nsocial and economic vulnerability.\\nSome controversial studies indicate that the\\nincrease in violent or upsetting pictures and stories in\\nnews reports and entertainment may raise the anxiety\\nlevel of many people. Stress and anxiety management\\nprograms often suggest that patients cut down their\\nexposure to upsetting stimuli.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 359\\nAnxiety'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 389, 'page_label': '390'}, page_content='Anxiety may also be caused by environmental or\\noccupational factors. People who must live or work\\naround sudden or loud noises, bright or flashing lights,\\nchemical vapors, or similar nuisances, which they cannot\\navoid or control, may develop heightened anxiety levels.\\nExistential anxiety\\nAnother factor that shapes human experiences of\\nanxiety is knowledge of personal mortality. Humans are\\nthe only animals that appear to be aware of their limited\\nlife span. Some researchers think that awareness of\\ndeath influences experiences of anxiety from the time\\nthat a person is old enough to understand death.\\nSymptoms of anxiety\\nIn order to understand the diagnosis and treat-\\nment of anxiety, it is helpful to have a basic under-\\nstanding of its symptoms.\\nSOMATIC. The somatic or physical symptoms of\\nanxiety include headaches,dizziness or lightheaded-\\nness, nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhea, tingling, pale\\ncomplexion, sweating,numbness, difficulty in breath-\\ning, and sensations of tightness in the chest, neck,\\nshoulders, or hands. These symptoms are produced\\nby the hormonal, muscular, and cardiovascular reac-\\ntions involved in the fight-or-flight reaction. Children\\nand adolescents withgeneralized anxiety disordershow\\na high percentage of physical complaints.\\nBEHAVIORAL. Behavioral symptoms of anxiety\\ninclude pacing, trembling, general restlessness, hyper-\\nventilation, pressured speech, hand wringing, or finger\\ntapping.\\nCOGNITIVE. Cognitive symptoms of anxiety\\ninclude recurrent or obsessive thoughts, feelings of\\ndoom, morbid or fear-inducing thoughts or ideas,\\nand confusion, or inability to concentrate.\\nEMOTIONAL. Feeling states associated with anxi-\\nety include tension or nervousness, feeling ‘‘hyper’’ or\\n‘‘keyed up,’’ and feelings of unreality, panic, or terror.\\nDEFENSE MECHANISMS. In psychoanalytic theory,\\nthe symptoms of anxiety in humans may arise from or\\nactivate a number of unconscious defense mechan-\\nisms. Because of these defenses, it is possible for a\\nperson to be anxious without being consciously\\naware of it or appearing anxious to others. These\\npsychological defenses include:\\n/C15Repression. The person pushes anxious thoughts or\\nideas out of conscious awareness.\\n/C15Displacement. Anxiety from one source is attached\\nto a different object or event. Phobias are an example\\nof the mechanism of displacement in psychoanalytic\\ntheory.\\n/C15Rationalization. The person justifies the anxious\\nfeelings by saying that any normal person would\\nfeel anxious in their situation.\\n/C15Somatization. The anxiety emerges in the form of\\nphysical complaints and illnesses, such as recurrent\\nheadaches, stomach upsets, or muscle and joint pain.\\n/C15Delusion formation. The person converts anxious\\nfeelings into conspiracy theories or similar ideas\\nwithout reality testing. Delusion formation can\\ninvolve groups as well as individuals.\\nOther theorists attribute some drugaddictionto the\\ndesire to relieve symptoms of anxiety. Most addictions,\\nthey argue, originate in the use of mood-altering sub-\\nstances or behaviors to ‘‘medicate’’ anxious feelings.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of anxiety is difficult and complex\\nbecause of the variety of its causes and the highly\\npersonalized and individualized nature of its symptom\\nformation. There are no medical tests that can be used\\nto diagnose anxiety by itself. When a doctor examines\\nan anxious patient, he or she will first rule out physical\\nconditions and diseases that have anxiety as a symp-\\ntom. Apart from these exclusions, thephysical exam-\\nination is usually inconclusive. Some anxious patients\\nmay have their blood pressure or pulse rate affected by\\nanxiety, or may look pale or perspire heavily, but\\nothers may appear physically completely normal.\\nThe doctor will then take the patient’s medication,\\ndietary, and occupational history to see if they are\\ntaking prescription drugs that might cause anxiety, if\\nthey are abusing alcohol or mood-altering drugs,\\nif they are consuming large amounts of caffeine, or if\\ntheir workplace is noisy or dangerous. In most cases,\\nthe most important source of diagnostic information is\\nthe patient’s psychological and social history. The\\ndoctor may administer a brief psychological test to\\nhelp evaluate the intensity of the patient’s anxiety and\\nsome of its features. Some tests that are often given\\ninclude the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the Anxiety\\nDisorders Interview Schedule (ADIS). Many doctors\\nwill check a number of chemical factors in the blood,\\nsuch as the level of thyroid hormone and blood sugar.\\nTreatment\\nNot all patients with anxiety require treatment,\\nbut for more severe cases, treatment is recommended.\\nBecause anxiety often has more than one cause and is\\nexperienced in highly individual ways, its treatment\\n360 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAnxiety'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 390, 'page_label': '391'}, page_content='usually requires more than one type of therapy. In\\naddition, there is no way to tell in advance how\\npatients will respond to a specific drug or therapy.\\nSometimes the doctor will need to try different medi-\\ncations or methods of treatment before finding the\\nbest combination for the particular patient. It usually\\ntakes about six to eight weeks for the doctor to evalu-\\nate the effectiveness of a treatment regimen.\\nMedications\\nMedications are often prescribed to relieve the\\nphysical and psychological symptoms of anxiety.\\nMost agents work by counteracting the biochemical\\nand muscular changes involved in the fight-or-flight\\nreaction. Some work directly on the chemicals in the\\nbrain that are thought to underlie the anxiety.\\nANXIOLYTICS. Anxiolytics are sometimes called\\ntranquilizers. Most anxiolytic drugs are eitherbenzo-\\ndiazepines or barbiturates. Barbiturates, once com-\\nmonly used, are now rarely used in clinical practice.\\nBarbiturates work by slowing down the transmission\\nof nerve impulses from the brain to other parts\\nof the body. They include such drugs as phenobarbital\\n(Luminal) and pentobarbital (Nembutal). Benzodia-\\nzepines work by relaxing the skeletal muscles and\\ncalming the limbic system. They include such drugs\\nas chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and diazepam\\n(Valium). Both barbiturates and benzodiazepines are\\npotentially habit-forming and may cause withdrawal\\nsymptoms, but benzodiazepines are far less likely than\\nbarbiturates to cause physical dependency. Both drugs\\nalso increase the effects of alcohol and should never be\\ntaken in combination with it.\\nTwo other types of anxiolytic medications\\ninclude meprobamate (Equanil), which is now\\nrarely used, and buspirone (BuSpar), a new type\\nof anxiolytic that appears to work by increasing\\nthe efficiency of the body’s own emotion-regulating\\nbrain chemicals. Buspirone has several advantages\\nover other anxiolytics. It does not cause depen-\\ndence problems, does not interact with alcohol,\\nand does not affect the patient’s ability to drive\\nor operate machinery. However, buspirone is not\\neffective against certain types of anxiety, such as\\npanic disorder.\\nANTIDEPRESSANTS AND BETA-BLOCKERS. For some\\nanxiety disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disor-\\nder and panic type anxiety, a type of drugs used to treat\\ndepression,selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\\n(SSRIs; such as Prozac and Paxil), are the treatment\\nof choice. A newer drug that has been shown as effec-\\ntive as Paxil is called escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro).\\nBecause anxiety often coexists with symptoms of\\ndepression, many doctors prescribe antidepressant\\nmedications for anxious/depressed patients. While\\nSSRIs are more common, antidepressants are some-\\ntimes prescribed, includingtricyclic antidepressants\\nsuch as imipramine (Tofranil) ormonoamine oxidase\\ninhibitors (MAO inhibitors) such as phenelzine\\n(Nardil).\\nBeta-blockers are medications that work by\\nblocking the body’s reaction to the stress hormones\\nthat are released during the fight-or-flight reaction.\\nThey include drugs like propranolol (Inderal) or ate-\\nnolol (Tenormin). Beta-blockers are sometimes given\\nto patients with post-traumatic anxiety symptoms.\\nMore commonly, the beta-blockers are given to\\npatients with a mild form of social phobic anxiety,\\nsuch as fear of public speaking.\\nPsychotherapy\\nMost patients with anxiety will be given some\\nform of psychotherapy along with medications.\\nMany patients benefit from insight-oriented therapies,\\nwhich are designed to help them uncover unconscious\\nconflicts and defense mechanisms in order to under-\\nstand how their symptoms developed. Patients who\\nare extremely anxious may benefit from supportive\\npsychotherapy, which aims at symptom reduction\\nrather than personality restructuring.\\nTwo newer approaches that work well with\\nanxious patients are cognitive-behavioral therapy\\n(CBT), and relaxation training. In CBT, the patient\\nis taught to identify the thoughts and situations that\\nstimulate his or her anxiety, and to view them more\\nrealistically. In the behavioral part of the program, the\\npatient is exposed to the anxiety-provoking object,\\nsituation, or internal stimulus (like a rapid heart\\nbeat) in gradual stages until he or she is desensitized\\nto it. Relaxation training, which is sometimes called\\nanxiety management training, includes breathing exer-\\ncises and similar techniques intended to help the\\npatient prevent hyperventilation and relieve the mus-\\ncle tension associated with the fight-or-flight reaction.\\nBoth CBT and relaxation training can be used in\\ngroup therapy as well as individual treatment. In addi-\\ntion to CBT, support groups are often helpful to\\nanxious patients, because they provide a social net-\\nwork and lessen the embarrassment that often accom-\\npanies anxiety symptoms.\\nPsychosurgery\\nSurgery on the brain is very rarely recommended\\nfor patients with anxiety; however, some patients with\\nsevere cases ofobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 361\\nAnxiety'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 391, 'page_label': '392'}, page_content='have been helped by an operation on a part of\\nthe brain that is involved in OCD.

Anxiety is associated with a wide range of\\nphysical illnesses, medication side effects, and other\\npsychiatric disorders.\\nThe revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical\\nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM)that took place\\nafter 1980 brought major changes in the classification\\nof the anxiety disorders. Prior to 1980, psychiatrists\\nclassified patients on the basis of a theory that defined\\nanxiety as the outcome of unconscious conflicts in the\\npatient’s mind.DSM-III (1980), DSM-III-R (1987),\\nand DSM-IV (1994) introduced and refined a new\\nclassification that considered recent discoveries\\nabout the biochemical and post-traumatic origins\\nof some types of anxiety. The present definitions\\nare based on the external and reported symptom\\npatterns of the disorders rather than on theories\\nabout their origins.\\nDescription\\nAnxiety disorders are the most common form of\\nmental disturbance in the United States population. It is\\nestimated that 28 million people suffer from an anxiety\\ndisorder every year. These disorders are a serious pro-\\nblem for the entire society because of their interference\\nwith patients’ work, schooling, and family life. They\\nalso contribute to the high rates of alcohol and sub-\\nstanceabuse in the United States. Anxiety disorders\\nare an additional problem for health professionals\\nbecause the physical symptoms of anxiety frequently\\nbring people to primary care doctors or emergency\\nrooms.\\nDSM-IV defines 12 types of anxiety disorders in\\nthe adult population.

The aorta, which can\\ndevelop these abnormal bulges, is the large blood\\nvessel that carries oxygen-rich blood away from the\\nheart to the rest of the body.\\nDescription\\nThe aorta carries oxygen-rich blood to the body,\\nand is therefore called an artery. Because the aorta is an\\nartery, its walls are made of up three layers; a thin inner\\nlayer, a muscular middle layer (that gives the vessel its\\nflexibility under pressure from the filling blood), and a\\nfiber-like outer layer that gives the vessel strength to not\\nburst when the heart pumps blood to the body.\\nAortic aneurysms occur when a weakness devel-\\nops in part of the wall of the aorta; three basic\\ntypes are usually found. If all three layers of the\\nvessel are affected and weakness develops along an\\nextended area of the vessel, the weakened area will\\nappear as a large, bulging region of blood vessel;\\nthis is called a fusiform aneurysm. If weakness\\ndevelops between the inner and outer layers of the\\naortic wall, a bulge results as blood from the inter-\\nior of the vessel is pushed around the damaged\\nregion in the wall and collects between these layers.\\nThis is called a dissecting aneurysm because one\\nlayer is ‘‘dissected’’ or separated from another. If\\ndamage occurs to only the middle (muscular) layer\\nof the vessel, a sack-like bulge can form; therefore,\\nthis is a saccular aneurysm.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAortic aneurysms occur in different portions of\\nthe aorta, which begins in the chest (at the heart) and\\ntravels downward through the abdomen. Aneurysms\\nfound in the region of the aorta within the chest are\\ncalled thoracic aortic aneurysms. Aneurysms that\\noccur in the part of the aorta within the abdomen are\\ncalled abdominal aortic aneurysms.\\nThoracic aortic aneurysms do not usually pro-\\nduce any noticeable symptoms. However, as the\\naneurysm becomes larger, chest, shoulder, neck,\\nlower back, or abdominalpain can result.\\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms occur more often in\\nmen, and these aneurysms can cause pain in the\\nlower back, hips, and abdomen. A painful abdomi-\\nnal aortic aneurysm usually means that the aneurysm\\ncould burst very soon.\\nMost abdominal aortic aneurysms are caused by\\natherosclerosis, a condition caused when fat (mostly\\ncholesterol) carried in the blood builds up in the inner\\nwall of the aorta. As more and more fat attaches to the\\naortic wall, the wall itself becomes abnormally weak\\nand often results in an aneurysm or bulge.\\nAn aneurysm in progress.

The dissect-\\ning aorta usually does not burst, but has an abnormal\\nsecond channel within it.\\nDescription\\nA defect in the inner lining of the aorta allows an\\nopening or tear to develop. The aorta is the main\\nartery of the body and is an area of high blood\\npressure. When a defect develops, blood pressure can\\nforce the tear to open and allow blood to pass through.\\nSince the blood is under pressure, it eventually splits\\n(dissecting) the middle layer of the blood vessel, creat-\\ning a new channel for blood. The length of the channel\\ngrows over time and can result in the closing off of\\nconnection points to other arteries. This can lead to\\nheart attack, strokes, abdominal pain, and nerve\\ndamage. Blood may leak from the dissection and col-\\nlect in the chest an around the heart.\\nA second mechanism leading to aortic dissection\\nis medial hemorrhage. A medial hemorrhage occurs in\\nthe middle layer of the blood vessel and spills through\\nthe inner lining of the aorta wall. This opening then\\nallows blood from the aorta to enter the vessel wall\\nand begin a dissection. Approximately 2,000 cases of\\naortic dissection occur yearly in the United States.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAortic dissection is caused by a deterioration of\\nthe inner lining of the aorta. There are a number of\\nconditions that predispose a person to develop defects\\nof the inner lining, including high blood pressure,\\nMarfan’s disease,Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, connective\\ntissue diseases, and defects of heart development\\nwhich begin during fetal development. A dissection\\ncan also occur accidentally following insertion of a\\ncatheter, trauma, or surgery. The main symptom is sud-\\nden, intense pain. The pain can be so intense as to\\nimmobilize the patient and cause him to fall to the\\nground. The pain is frequently felt in both the chest\\nand in the back, between the shoulder blades. The extent\\nof the pain isproportional tothe lengthof the dissection.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe pain experienced by the patient is the first\\nsymptom of aortic dissection and is unique. The pain is\\nusually described by the patient as ‘‘tearing, ripping, or\\nstabbing.’’ This is in contrastto the pain associated with\\nheart attacks. The patient frequently has a reduced or\\nabsent pulse in the extremities. A murmur may be heard\\nif the dissection is close to the heart.

The use of a blood dye in angio-\\ngrams and/or CT scans (computed tomography scans)\\nwill aid in diagnosing and visualizing the dissection.\\nTreatment\\nBecause of the potentially fatal nature of aortic\\ndissection, patients are treated immediately.

With\\neach contraction of the heart more and more blood\\nflows back into the left ventricle, causing the ven-\\ntricle to become overfilled.

When\\nthe valve narrows, as it does with stenosis, blood flow\\nis impeded. Because it is more difficult for blood\\nto flow through the valve, there is increased strain on\\nthe heart. This can cause the left ventricle to enlarge\\nand malfunction, resulting in reduced blood supply to\\nthe heart muscle and body, as well as fluid build up in\\nthe lungs.\\nCause and symptoms\\nAortic valve stenosis can occur because of a birth\\ndefect in the formation of the valve. Calcium deposits\\nmay form on the valve withaging, causing the valve to\\nbecome stiff and narrow. Stenosis can also occur as a\\nresult ofrheumatic fever. Mild aortic stenosis may\\nproduce no symptoms at all. The most common symp-\\ntoms, depending on the severity of the disease, are\\nchestpain, blackouts, and difficulty breathing.\\nKEY TERMS\\nRheumatic fever— A disease believed to be caused\\nby a bacterium named group A streptococcus. This\\nbacterium causes a sore ‘‘strep throat’’ and can also\\nresult in fever.

It is performed twice,\\nfirst at one minute and then again at five minutes after\\nbirth.\\nPurpose\\nApgar scoring was originally developed in the\\n1950s by the anesthesiologist Virginia Apgar to assist\\npractitioners attending a birth in deciding whether or\\nnot a newborn was in need of resuscitation. Using a\\nscoring method fosters consistency and standardiza-\\ntion among different practitioners. A February 2001\\nstudy published in the New England Journal of\\nMedicine investigated whether Apgar scoring con-\\ntinues to be relevant. Researchers concluded that\\n‘‘The Apgar scoring system remains as relevant for\\nthe prediction of neonatal survival today as it was\\nalmost 50 years ago.’’\\nDescription\\nThe five areas are scored as follows:\\n/C15Appearance, or color: 2 if the skin is pink all over; 1\\nfor acrocyanosis, where the trunk and head are pink,\\nbut the arms and legs are blue; and 0 if the whole\\nbody is blue. Newborns with naturally darker skin\\ncolor will not be pink. However, pallor is still notice-\\nable, especially in the soles and palms. Color is\\nrelated to the neonate’s ability to oxygenate its\\nbody and extremities, and is dependent on heart\\nrate and respirations. A perfectly healthy newborn\\nwill often receive a score of 9 because of some blue-\\nness in the hands and feet.\\n/C15Pulse (heart rate): 2 for a pulse of 100+ beats per\\nminute (bpm); 1 for a pulse below 100 bpm; 0 for no\\npulse. Heart rate is assessed by listening with a\\nstethoscope to the newborn’s heart and counting\\nthe number of beats.\\n/C15Grimace, or reflex irritability: 2 if the neonate\\ncoughs, sneezes, or vigorously cries in response to a\\nstimulus (such as the use of nasal suctioning, stroking\\nthe back to assess for spinal abnormalities, or having\\nthe foot tapped); 1 for a slight cry or grimace in\\nresponse to the stimulus; 0 for no response.\\n/C15Activity, or muscle tone: 2 for vigorous movements\\nof arms and legs; 1 for some movement; 0 for no\\nmovement, limpness.\\n/C15Respirations: 2 for visible breathing and crying; 1\\nfor slow, weak, irregular breathing; 0 for apnea,\\nor no breathing. A crying newborn can ade-\\nquately oxygenate its lungs. Respirations are best\\nassessed by watching the rise and fall of the neo-\\nnate’s abdomen, as infants are diaphragmatic\\nbreathers.\\nThe combined first letters in these five areas spell\\nApgar.\\nPreparation\\nNo preparation is needed to perform the test.\\nHowever, while being born the neonate may receive\\nnasal and oral suctioning to remove mucus and\\namniotic fluid. This may be done when the head of\\nthe newborn is safely out, while the mother rests\\nbefore she continues to push.\\nAftercare\\nSince the test is primarily observational in nature,\\nno aftercare is needed. However, the test may flag the\\nneed for immediate intervention or prolonged\\nobservation.\\nNormal results\\nThe maximum possible score is 10, the minimum\\nis zero. It is rare to receive a true 10, as some acrocya-\\nnosis in the newborn is considered normal, and there-\\nfore not a cause for concern. Most infants score\\nbetween 7 and 10. These infants are expected to have\\nan excellent outcome. A score of 4, 5, or 6 requires\\nimmediate intervention, usually in the form of oxygen\\nand respiratory assistance, or perhaps just suctioning\\nif breathing has been obstructed by mucus. While\\nsuctioning is being done, a source of oxygen may be\\nplaced near, but not over the newborn’s nose and\\nmouth. This form of oxygen is referred to asblow-by.\\nA score in the 4-6 range indicates that the neonate is\\nhaving some difficulty adapting to extrauterine life.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 371\\nApgar testing'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 401, 'page_label': '402'}, page_content='This may be due to medications given to the mother\\nduring a difficult labor, or at the very end of labor,\\nwhen these medications have an exaggerated effect on\\nthe neonate.\\nAbnormal results\\nWith a score of 0-3, the newborn is unresponsive,\\napneic, pale, limp and may not have a pulse.\\nInterventions to resuscitate will begin immediately.\\nThe test is repeated at five minutes after birth and\\nboth scores are documented.

A person with aphasia may\\nhave difficulty speaking, reading, writing, recognizing\\nthe names of objects, or understanding what other\\npeople have said. Aphasia is caused by a brain injury,\\nas may occur during a traumatic accident or when\\nthe brain is deprived of oxygen during astroke.I t\\nmay also be caused by abrain tumor, a disease such\\nas Alzheimer’s, or an infection, like encephalitis.\\nAphasia may be temporary or permanent. Aphasia\\ndoes not include speech impediments caused by loss\\nof muscle control.\\nDescription\\nTo understand and use language effectively, an\\nindividual draws upon word memory–stored informa-\\ntion on what certain words mean, how to put them\\ntogether, and how and when to use them properly. For\\na majority of people, these and other language func-\\ntions are located in the left side (hemisphere) of the\\nbrain. Damage to this side of the brain is most com-\\nmonly linked to the development of aphasia.\\nInterestingly, however, left-handed people appear to\\nhave language areas in both the left and right hemi-\\nspheres of the brain and, as a result, may develop\\naphasia from damage to either side of the brain.\\nStroke is the most common cause of aphasia in the\\nUnited States. Approximately 500,000 individuals suf-\\nfer strokes each year, and 20% of these individuals\\ndevelop some type of aphasia. Other causes of brain\\ndamage include head injuries, brain tumors, and infec-\\ntion. About half of the people who show signs of apha-\\nsia have what is called temporary or transient aphasia\\nand recover completely within a few days. An estimated\\none million Americans suffer from some form of per-\\nmanent aphasia. As yet, no connection between aphasia\\nand age, gender, or race has been found.\\nAphasia is sometimes confused with other condi-\\ntions that affect speech, such as dysarthria and\\napraxia. These condition affect the muscles used in\\nspeaking rather than language function itself.\\nDysarthria is a speech disturbance caused by lack of\\ncontrol over the muscles used in speaking, perhaps due\\nto nerve damage. Speech apraxia is a speech distur-\\nbance in which language comprehension and muscle\\ncontrol are retained, but the memory of how to use the\\nmuscles to form words is not.\\nBroca's area\\nWernicke's area\\nBroca’s aphasia results from damage to the frontal lobe of the\\nlanguage-dominant area of the brain.

The patient is likely to appear pale. If\\nthe anemia progresses, decreased oxygen circulating in\\nthe blood may lead to an increase in heart rate and the\\nsudden appearance of a new heart murmur.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe blood countin aplastic anemia will reveal low\\nnumbers of all formed blood cells.

The appendix is a worm-shaped hollow\\npouch attached to the cecum, the beginning of the\\nlarge intestine.\\nPurpose\\nAppendectomies are performed to treatappendi-\\ncitis, an inflamed and infected appendix.\\nPrecautions\\nSince appendicitis occurs most commonly in\\nmales between the ages of 10-14 and in females\\nbetween the ages of 15-19, appendectomy is most\\noften performed during this time. The diagnosis of\\nappendicitis is most difficult in the very young (less\\nthan two years of age) and in the elderly.\\nDescription\\nAppendectomy is considered a major surgical\\noperation. Therefore, a general surgeon must perform\\nthis operation in the operating room of a hospital. An\\nanesthesiologist is also present during the operation to\\nadminister an anesthetic. Most often the anesthesiol-\\nogist uses a general anesthetic technique whereby\\npatients are put to sleep and madepain free by\\nadministering drugs in the vein or by agents inhaled\\nthrough a tube placed in the windpipe. Occasionally a\\nspinal anesthetic may be used.\\nAfter the patient is anesthetized, the general\\nsurgeon can remove the appendix either by using\\nthe traditional open procedure (in which a 2-3 in\\n[5-7.6 cm] incision is made in the abdomen) or via\\nlaparoscopy (in which four 1 in [2.5cm] incisions are\\nmade in the abdomen).\\nTraditional open appendectomy\\nWhen the surgeon uses the open approach, he\\nmakes an incision in the lower right section of the\\nabdomen. Most incisions are less than 3 in (7.6 cm)\\nin length. The surgeon then identifies all of the organs\\nin the abdomen and examines them for other disease\\nor abnormalities. The appendix is located and brought\\nup into thewounds. The surgeon separates the appen-\\ndix from all the surrounding tissue and its attachment\\nto the cecum and then removes it. The site where the\\nappendix was previously attached, the cecum, is closed\\nand returned to the abdomen. The muscle layers and\\nthen the skin are sewn together.\\nLaproscopic appendectomy\\nWhen the surgeon conducts a laproscopic appen-\\ndectomy, four incisions, each about 1 in (2.5 cm) in\\nlength, are made. One incision is near the umbilicus, or\\nnavel, and one is between the umbilicus and the pubis.\\nTwo other incisions are smaller and are in the right\\n378 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAppendectomy'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 408, 'page_label': '409'}, page_content='side of the lower abdomen. The surgeon then passes a\\ncamera and special instruments through these inci-\\nsions. With the aid of this equipment, the surgeon\\nvisually examines the abdominal organs and identifies\\nthe appendix. Similarly, the appendix is freed from\\nall of its attachments and removed. The place where\\nthe appendix was formerly attached, the cecum, is\\nstitched. The appendix is removed through one of the\\nincisions. The instruments are removed and then all of\\nthe incisions are closed.\\nStudies and opinions about the relative advan-\\ntages and disadvantages of each method are divided.\\nA skilled surgeon can perform either one of these\\nprocedures in less than one hour. However, lapro-\\nscopic appendectomy (LA) always takes longer than\\ntraditional appendectomy (TA). The increased time\\nrequired to do a LA increases the patient’s exposure\\nto anesthetics, which increases the risk of complica-\\ntions. The increased time requirement also escalates\\nfees charged by the hospital for operating room time\\nand by the anesthesiologist. Since LA also requires\\nspecialized equipment, the fees for its use also\\nincreases the hospital charges. Patients with either\\noperation have similar pain medication needs, begin\\neatingdiets at comparable times, and stay in the hos-\\npital equivalent amounts of time. LA is of special\\nbenefit in women in whom the diagnosis is difficult\\nand gynecological disease (such asendometriosis,p e l -\\nvic inflammatory disease, ruptured ovarian follicles,\\nruptured ovarian cysts, and tubal pregnancies) may be\\nthe source of pain and not appendicitis.

Fees are charged independently by the hospital\\nand the physicians. Hospital charges include fees for\\noperating and recovery room use, diagnostic and\\nlaboratory testing, as well as the normal hospital\\nroom charges. Surgical fees vary from region to region\\nand range between $250-$750. The anesthesiologist’s\\nfee depends upon the health of the patient and the\\nlength of the operation.\\nPreparation\\nOnce the diagnosis of appendicitis is made and the\\ndecision has been made to perform an appendectomy,\\nthe patient undergoes the standard preparation for an\\noperation. This usually takes only one to two hours\\nand includes signing the operative consents, patient\\nidentification procedures, evaluation by the anesthe-\\nsiologist, and moving the patient to the operating suites\\nof the hospital. Occasionally, if the patient has been ill\\nfor a prolonged period of time or has had protracted\\nvomiting, a delay of few to several hours may be neces-\\nsary to give the patient fluids and antibiotics.\\nAftercare\\nRecovery from an appendectomy is similar to\\nother operations. Patients are allowed to eat when\\nthe stomach and intestines begin to function again.\\nUsually the first meal is a clear liquid diet–broth,\\njuice, soda pop, and gelatin. If patients tolerate this\\nmeal, the next meal usually is a regular diet. Patients\\nare asked to walk and resume their normal physical\\nactivities as soon as possible. If TA was done, work\\nand physical education classes may be restricted for a\\nfull three weeks after the operation. If a LA was done,\\nmost patients are able to return to work and strenuous\\nactivity within one to three weeks after the operation.\\nRisks\\nCertain risks are present when any operation\\nrequires a general anesthetic and the abdominal cavity\\nis opened.Pneumonia and collapse of the small air-\\nways (atelectasis) often occurs. Patients who smoke\\nare at a greater risk for developing these complica-\\ntions. Thrombophlebitis, or inflammation of the\\nveins, is rare but can occur if the patient requires\\nprolonged bed rest. Bleeding can occur but rarely is a\\nbloodtransfusion required. Adhesions (abnormal con-\\nnections to abdominal organs by thin fibrous tissue) is\\na known complication of any abdominal procedure\\nsuch as appendectomy. Theseadhesions can lead to\\nintestinal obstruction which prevents the normal flow\\nof intestinal contents.Hernia is a complication of any\\nincision, However, they are rarely seen after appen-\\ndectomy because the abdominal wall is very strong in\\nthe area of the standard appendectomy incision.\\nThe overall complication rate of appendectomy\\ndepends upon the status of the appendix at the time\\nit is removed. If the appendix has not ruptured the\\ncomplication rate is only about 3%. However, if the\\nappendix has ruptured the complication rate rises to\\nalmost 59%.

More males\\nthan females develop appendicitis between puberty\\nand age 25. It is rare in the elderly and in children\\nunder the age of two.\\nThe hallmark symptom of appendicitis is increas-\\ningly severe abdominalpain. Since many different con-\\nditions can cause abdominal pain, an accurate\\ndiagnosis of appendicitis can be difficult. A timely\\ndiagnosis is important, however, because a delay can\\nresult in perforation, or rupture, of the appendix.\\nWhen this happens, the infected contents of the appen-\\ndix spill into the abdomen, potentially causing a ser-\\nious infection of the abdomen calledperitonitis.\\nAn extracted appendix.

Signs of rupture include the\\npresence of symptoms for more than 24 hours, afever,a\\nhigh white blood cell count, and a fast heart rate. Very\\nrarely, the inflammation and symptoms of appendicitis\\nmay disappear but recur again later.\\nThe distinguishing symptom of appendicitis is\\npain beginning around or above the navel. The pain,\\nwhich may be severe or only achy and uncomfortable,\\neventually moves into the right lower corner of the\\nabdomen. There, it becomes more steady and more\\nsevere, and often increases with movement, coughing,\\nand so forth. The abdomen often becomes rigid and\\ntender to the touch. Increasing rigidity and tenderness\\nindicates an increased likelihood of perforation and\\nperitonitis.\\nLoss of appetite is very common. Nausea and\\nvomiting may occur in about half of the cases and\\noccasionally there may be constipation or diarrhea.\\nThe temperature may be normal or slightly elevated.\\nThe presence of a fever may indicate that the appendix\\nhas ruptured.\\nDiagnosis\\nA careful examination is the best way to diag-\\nnose appendicitis. It is o ften difficult even for\\nexperienced physicians to distinguish the symptoms\\nof appendicitis from those of other abdominal dis-\\norders. Therefore, very specific questioning and a\\nthorough physical examination are crucial. The\\nphysician should ask questions, such as where the\\npain is centered, whether the pain has shifted, and\\nwhere the pain began. The physician should press\\non the abdomen to judge the location of the pain\\nand the degree of tenderness.\\nThe typical sequence of symptoms is present in\\nabout 50% of cases. In the other half of cases, less\\ntypical patterns may be seen, especially in pregnant\\nwomen, older patients, and infants. In pregnant\\nwomen, appendicitis is easily masked by the fre-\\nquent occurrence of mild abdominal pain and\\nnauseafrom other causes. Elderly patients may\\nfeel less pain and tenderness than most patients,\\nthereby delaying diagnosis and treatment, and\\nleading to rupture in 30% of cases. Infants and\\nyoung children often have diarrhea, vomiting,\\nand fever in addition to pain.\\nWhile laboratory tests cannot establish the diag-\\nnosis, an increased white cell count may point to\\nappendicitis. Urinalysis may help to rule out a urinary\\ntract infection that can mimic appendicitis.\\nPatients whose symptoms andphysical examina-\\ntion are compatible with a diagnosis of appendicitis\\nare usually taken immediately to surgery, where a\\nlaparotomy (surgical exploration of the abdomen) is\\ndone to confirm the diagnosis. In cases with a ques-\\ntionable diagnosis, other tests, such as a computed\\ntomography scan (CT) may be performed to avoid\\nunnecessary surgery. An ultrasound examination of\\nthe abdomen may help to identify an inflamed appen-\\ndix or other condition that would explain the symp-\\ntoms. Abdominal x-rays are not of much value except\\nwhen the appendix has ruptured.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAppendectomy (or appendicectomy)— Surgical\\nremoval of the appendix.\\nAppendix— The worm-shaped pouch attached to\\nthe cecum, the beginning of the large intestine.\\nLaparotomy— Surgical incision into the loin,\\nbetween the ribs and the pelvis, which offers sur-\\ngeons a view inside the abdominal cavity.\\nPeritonitis— Inflammation of the peritoneum,\\nmembranes lining the abdominal pelvic wall.\\n382 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAppendicitis'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 412, 'page_label': '413'}, page_content='Often, the diagnosis is not certain until an opera-\\ntion is done. To avoid a ruptured appendix, surgery\\nmay be recommended without delay if the symptoms\\npoint clearly to appendicitis. If the symptoms are not\\nclear, surgery may be postponed until they progress\\nenough to confirm a diagnosis.\\nWhen appendicitis is strongly suspected in a\\nwoman of child-bearing age, a diagnostic laparoscopy\\n(an examination of the interior of the abdomen) is\\nsometimes recommended before the appendectomy in\\norder to be sure that a gynecological problem, such as a\\nruptured ovarian cyst, is not causing the pain. In this\\nprocedure, a lighted viewing tube is inserted into the\\nabdomen through a small incision around the navel.\\nA normal appendix is discovered in about 10-20%\\nof patients who undergo laparotomy, because of sus-\\npected appendicitis. Sometimes the surgeon will\\nremove a normal appendix as a safeguard against\\nappendicitis in the future. During the surgery, another\\nspecific cause for the pain and symptoms of appendi-\\ncitis is found for about 30% of these patients.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment of appendicitis is an immediate\\nappendectomy. This may be done by opening the abdo-\\nmen in the standard open appendectomy technique, or\\nthrough laparoscopy. In laparoscopy, a smaller incision\\nis made through the navel. Both methods can success-\\nfully accomplish the removal of the appendix. It is not\\ncertain that laparoscopy holds any advantage over open\\nappendectomy. When the appendix has ruptured,\\npatients undergoing a laparoscopic appendectomy may\\nhave to be switched to the open appendectomy proce-\\ndure for the successful management of the rupture. If a\\nruptured appendix is left untreated, the condition is fatal.\\nPrognosis\\nAppendicitis is usually treated successfully by\\nappendectomy. Unless there are complications, the\\npatient should recover without further problems. The\\nmortality rate in cases without complications is less\\nthan 0.1%. When an appendix has ruptured, or a\\nsevere infection has developed, the likelihood is higher\\nfor complications, with slower recovery, or death from\\ndisease.

The medications most often used\\nin the early 2000s include mirtazapine (Remeron), a\\ntetracyclic antidepressant; cyproheptadine (Periactin),\\nan antihistamine; dronabinol (Marinol, THC), an\\nantiemetic; nandrolone, oxymetholone, and oxandro-\\nlone (Anadrol-50, Durabolin, Hybolin, Oxandrin, and\\nother brand nam! es), which are anabolic steroids\\nrelated to the male sex hormone testosterone; and\\nmegestrol acetate (Megace), a synthetic derivative of\\nthe female sex hormone progesterone. In addition to\\nthese prescription drugs, fish oil (eicosapentaenoic acid\\nor EPA) has been recommended as an alternative\\nor complementary treatment for undesired weight loss.\\nPurpose\\nThe reader should note the distinction between\\nappetite and hunger in order to understand why a\\ngroup of such different medications could be used to\\nstimulate the desire for food. Hunger is defined as the\\nbody’s basic physical need for food, whether in terms\\nof calorie content or specific nutrients. Appetite, on\\nthe other hand, refers to the complex desires in\\nhumans for food and drink that are often conditioned\\nor influenced by previous experiences or cultural fac-\\ntors as well as by a person’s present health status.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 383\\nAppetite-enhancing drugs'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 413, 'page_label': '414'}, page_content='People may have an appetite for food in the absence of\\nhunger; conversely, they may be hungry in the physical\\nsense but have little or no appetite. Loss of appetite\\nmay lead to a type ofmalnutrition known as under-\\nnutrition, which is characterized by food intake that\\nfalls below a recommended daily allowance of calories\\nor by the body’s inability to make use of the nutrients\\nin the food that is consumed.\\nPeople may become anorexic (lose their appetite\\nfor food) for a variety of physical, emotional, and\\nsocial reasons:\\n/C15Sensory changes related toaging. Elderly persons\\noften experience a partial loss of the senses of taste\\nand smell, which means that they may not enjoy their\\nmeals as much as they did when they were younger.\\nIn addition, many elderly persons feel full after eat-\\ning relatively small amounts of food. It is thought\\nthat this early feeling of fullness is caused by\\nincreased secretion of gastric hormones known as\\ncholecystokinins.\\n/C15Gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with such disor-\\nders as Crohn’s disease or gastric atonia (abnormally\\nslow emptying of the stomach) may lose their appe-\\ntite for food.\\n/C15Severe diseases that affect the entire body, particu-\\nlarly cancer and AIDS. Patients with these diseases\\nmay develop cachexia, a potentially life-threatening\\ncondition characterized by unintended weight loss\\nand wasting of lean muscle tissue. Cachexia is often\\naccompanied by loss of appetite.\\n/C15Medication side effects. In addition to the drugs used\\nin cancerchemotherapy, such drugs as fluoxetine\\n(Prozac), digoxin (Lanoxin), quinidine (Duraquin,\\nCardioquin), hydralazine (Alazine, Apresoline), cer-\\ntainantibiotics, and vitamin A may cause loss of\\nappetite.\\n/C15Emotional stress. Many people do not feel like eating\\nbefore examinations, job interviews, public speaking,\\nartistic performances, athletic competitions, or simi-\\nlar stressful situations.\\n/C15Depression and othermood disorders. Loss of appe-\\ntite is a common feature of depressive episodes as\\nwell as of major depressive disorder.\\n/C15Cultural factors. The types of food that people find\\nappetizing are influenced by their respective cultures;\\nfor example, Westerners usually find the use of cats\\nand dogs for food in China and Korea upsetting or\\ndisgusting because they regard these animals as\\ndomestic pets rather than dietary items. In addition,\\nmany people lose their appetite when they discover\\ninsects, hair, or other evidence of unsanitary\\nconditions in their food, or when they find that a\\ndish’s ingredients violate the dietary laws of their\\nreligion.\\n/C15Social isolation. Research indicates that human\\nappetite for food is stimulated by eating in the com-\\npany of others. Loss of appetite in many elderly\\npeople is associated with living alone.\\n/C15Previous experience. People who have developed\\nfood poisoningafter eating contaminated or impro-\\nperly refrigerated salads, raw clams or oysters, or\\nsimilar foods may develop a long-term distaste for\\nthe food that made them sick.\\nGiven the complexity and variety of factors that\\ninfluence the desire for food in humans, doctors often\\nuse such questionnaires as the Mini Nutritional\\nAssessment or theNutrition Screening Index before\\nprescribing any appetite-enhancing drug. Many\\npatients can be successfully treated by changes in the\\ntype or dosage of medications they are taking for\\nother conditions, or by therapy directed at an under-\\nlying mood disorder or gastrointestinal disease.\\nOthers can be helped by changes in their living situa-\\ntions that allow them to share mealtimes with others\\nor by assistance in preparing foods that they particu-\\nlarly enjoy. The American Academy of Home Care\\nPhysicians (AAHCP) noted in a report published in\\nMay 2004 that the use of orexigenic drugs in the\\nelderly is ‘‘controversial and not generally FDA-\\napproved.’’\\nDescription\\nOrexigenic drugs used in the United States as of\\n2005 are classified as follows:\\n/C15Mirtazapine. Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic antidepres-\\nsant that was approved by the Food and Drug\\nAdministration (FDA) in 1996 for the treatment of\\nmajor depression. Although researchers do not fully\\nunderstand why mirtazapine relieves mood disor-\\nders, they think that it increases the levels of nora-\\ndrenaline and serotonin (chemicals that transmit\\nnerve impulses across the gaps between cells) in the\\nbrain. Mirtazapine is most often prescribed as an\\nappetite stimulant for patients who have been pre-\\nviously diagnosed with depression.\\n/C15Cyproheptadine. Cyproheptadine is an antihista-\\nmine given to relieve the symptoms of colds, nasal\\nallergies, and hayfever. It is also prescribed to relieve\\nthe itching associated with insect bites and stings,\\npoison ivy, and poison oak. It appears to be most\\neffective in treating loss of appetite in children and\\nadults diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.\\n384 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAppetite-enhancing drugs'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 414, 'page_label': '415'}, page_content='/C15Dronabinol. Dronabinol is a synthetic version of tet-\\nrahydrocannabinol (THC), the mood-altering com-\\npound found inmarijuana (Cannabis sativa ).\\nMarijuana has been known as an appetite stimulant\\nfor centuries, having been recommended for that pur-\\npose by Ayurvedic practitioners and by the Arabic\\nphysician Al Badri, who first described its orexigenic\\nproperties in 1251. Dronabinol is most commonly\\nused to treat thenausea and vomiting associated with\\nAIDS and with cancer chemotherapy.\\n/C15Anabolic steroids.

Megestrol acetate was first\\napproved by the FDA in 1976 for palliative treat-\\nment of metastatic breast orendometrial cancer.I t\\nreceived additional approval in 1993 for the\\ntreatment of anorexia or unexplained weight loss in\\npatients with AIDS. Researchers do not fully under-\\nstand how the drug prevents the growth of cancer\\ncells or how it stimulates appetite.\\n/C15Fish oil. Fish oil is recommended by some practi-\\ntioners as a nutritional supplement for weight loss\\ncaused by cancer or AIDS. It is thought that the\\nomega-3 fatty acidsin fish oil help to reduce the\\ninflammation associated with some forms of cancer\\ntherapy as well as helping patients regain lost weight.\\nAlthough some studies question the effectiveness of\\nfish oil as a complementary treatment for undesired\\nweight loss, the National Center for Complementary\\nand Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) is recruiting\\npatients as of April 2005 for a clinical trial of fish\\noil as a dietary supplement to maintain weight in\\npatients with pancreatic cancer.

Mirtazapine is available in 15- and 30-\\nmg tablets or disintegrating tablets. The usual start-\\ning dose is 15 mg once daily, usually at bedtime. The\\ndrug can be taken with or without food, as the\\npatient prefers.\\n/C15Cyproheptadine. Cyproheptadine is taken by mouth,\\neither as tablets or in liquid form. Adults are usually\\ngiven 4 mg three or four times per day. Children\\nbetween 2 and 6 years of age are usually given 12\\nmg per day in 3–4 divided doses while older children\\nare given 16 mg per day in divided doses.\\n/C15Dronabinol. As an appetite stimulant, dronabinol is\\ngiven as a 2.5-mg capsule twice a day, before lunch\\nand dinner. Some AIDS patients may be given as\\nmuch as 10 mg per day.\\n/C15Anabolic steroids. Oxandrolone and oxymetholone\\nare available in the United States and Canada as\\ntablets, while nandrolone is given by injection.

In January 2005 the FDA required\\nlabeling changes for mirtazapine to warn of the\\nincreased risk ofsuicide or self-harm in children or\\nadolescents taking this drug. Mirtazapine should not\\nbe given to children below 18 years of age, and\\nshould be used with caution in pregnant or lactating\\nwomen. Patients taking mirtazapine should not stop\\ntaking it without telling their doctor; it should not be\\ndiscontinued abruptly but taken in progressively\\nsmaller doses over a period of time. This precaution\\nis particularly important in patients who have been\\ntaking the drug for a long time.\\n/C15Cyproheptadine. This drug should not be given to\\npatients who suffer acuteasthma attacks or are\\nhypersensitive to antihistamines. It should not be\\ngiven to patients who have taken phenelzine\\n(Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate), or other MAO\\ninhibitors within the last two weeks. Cyproheptadine\\nshould be used cautiously in the elderly and in\\npatients withglaucoma, high blood pressure, or car-\\ndiovascular disease.\\n/C15Dronabinol. Patients t aking dronabinol should\\nbe closely supervised by their doctor, as the\\ndrug may cause unpredictable changes in blood\\npressure and heart rate. In addition, it may make\\ncertain mental disorders worse. It also has a high\\npotential for abuse; for this reason, it should be\\nused cautiously in patients with a history of\\nalcohol or drug abuse. Dronabinol should not\\nbe used by nursing mothers because it passes\\ninto breast milk. It should be used with great\\ncaution in children or patients diagnosed with\\nsevere mental illness because of its effects on\\nthe mind. Patients taking dronabinol should\\nnotify their dentist or surgeon before any proce-\\ndure requiring local or general anesthesia ,a st h e\\ndrug may intensify the effects of the anesthetic.\\nIn addition, these patients should not drive a car\\nor operate dangerous machinery until they know\\nwhether dronabinol makes them dizzy, drowsy,\\nor uncoordinated.\\n/C15Anabolic steroids. Patients taking these drugs must\\nfollow a diet high in protein and calories in order to\\nbenefit from the medications, and should be carefully\\nsupervised by their doctor because of possible side\\neffects. Children or teenagers taking these drugs\\nshould have x-rays every six months to make sure\\nthey are growing normally, as anabolic steroids can\\ninterfere with growth. Patients with diabetes should\\ncheck their blood sugar levels with extra care, as\\nthese drugs may cause rapid changes in blood sugar\\nlevels.\\n/C15Megestrol acetate. This drug should not be used by\\npregnant or lactating women, or by women planning\\nto become pregnant. Women of childbearing age\\nwho are taking megestrol should use a reliable form\\nof contraception.\\n/C15Fish oil. Fish oil is not a prescription drug; however,\\npatients who choose to take cod liver oil as their fish\\noil supplement should make sure that they are not\\ngetting more than the safe maximum daily allowan-\\nces ofvitamins A and D. These vitamins tend to build\\nup in the body and may reach toxic levels. The max-\\nimum safe daily level of vitamin A for adults is 3000\\nmicrograms (mcg).\\nSide effects\\nSide effects reported for orexigenic drugs are as\\nfollows:\\n/C15Mirtazapine. Mirtazapine may cause mood changes,\\nincluding worsening depression or thoughts of sui-\\ncide. It may also cause panic attacks, irritability,\\ndifficulty with impulse control, abnormal levels of\\nexcitement, or difficulty sleeping. Physical side\\neffects may include sleepiness,dry mouth, constipa-\\ntion, nausea and vomiting, flu-like symptoms, chest\\npain, and rapid heartbeat. Patients who have any of\\nthese side effects should consult their doctor at once.\\n/C15Cyproheptadine. Side effects include drowsiness,\\nfatigue, dry mouth, skin rash, chest congestion,head-\\nache, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, difficulty uri-\\nnating, and blurred vision. Patients who experience\\nurinary or vision problems should consult their doc-\\ntor at once.\\n/C15Dronabinol. Dronabinol may cause a variety of\\nchanges in mental status, includingdelirium, confu-\\nsion, hallucinations, memory loss,delusions, euphoria\\n(false sense of well-being), nervousness oranxiety.\\nBecause of the possibility of severe mental side\\neffects,anyone who has taken an overdose of dronabi-\\nnol needs immediate emergency medical help.

The damage affects the\\nbrain’s ability to correctly signal instructions to the\\nbody. Forms of apraxia include the inability to say\\nsome words or make gestures.\\nVarious conditions cause apraxia, and it can affect\\npeople of all ages. A baby might be born with the\\ncondition. A car accident or fall that resulted in head\\ntrauma could lead to apraxia.\\nFrom 500,000 to 750,000 people need to be hospi-\\ntalized each year for head injuries according to the\\nAmerican Medical Association (AMA). Men between\\nthe ages of 18 and 24 form the largest group of people\\nwith head injuries. While not all severe injuries result\\nin apraxia, men in that age group are at risk.\\nRisk factors for strokes include high blood pres-\\nsure, diabetes, and heart disease. Cigarettesmoking\\nalso puts a person at risk for a stroke. Brain tumors\\nare abnormal tissue growths in the skull. They may be\\nsecondary tumors caused by the spread of cancer\\nthrough the body.\\nThere is more than one type of apraxia, and a\\nperson may have one or more form of this condition.\\nFurthermore, a milder form of apraxia is called\\ndyspraxia.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nApraxia is caused by conditions that affect parts\\nof the brain that control movements. Apraxia is a\\nresult of damage to the brain’s cerebral hemispheres.\\nThese are the two halves of the cerebrum and are the\\nlocation of brain activities such as voluntary\\nmovements.\\nApraxia causes a lapse in carrying out movements\\nthat a person knows how to do, is physically able to\\nperform, and wants to do. A person may be willing\\nand able to do something like bathe. However, the\\nbrain does not send the signals that allow the person\\nto perform the necessary sequence of activities to do\\nthis correctly.\\n388 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nApraxia'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 418, 'page_label': '419'}, page_content='Types of apraxia\\nThere are several types of apraxia, and a patient\\ncould be diagnosed with one or more forms of this\\ncondition. The types of apraxia include:\\n/C15Buccofacial or orofacial apraxia is the inability of a\\nperson to follow through on commands involving\\nface and lip motions. These activities include cough-\\ning, licking the lips, whistling, and winking. Also\\nknown as facial-oral apraxia, it is the most common\\nform of apraxia, according to the National Institute\\nof Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).\\n/C15Limb-kinetic apraxia is the inability to make precise\\nmovements with an arm or leg.\\n/C15Ideomotor apraxia is the inability to make the proper\\nmovement in response to a command to pantomime\\nan activity like waving.\\n/C15Constructional apraxia is the inability to copy, draw,\\nor build simple figures.\\n/C15Ideational apraxia is the inability to do an activity\\nthat involves performing a series of movements in a\\nsequence. A person with this condition could have\\ntrouble dressing, eating, or bathing. It is also known\\nas conceptual apraxia.\\n/C15Oculomotor apraxia is characterized by difficulty\\nmoving the eyes.\\n/C15Verbal apraxia is a condition involving difficulty\\ncoordinating mouth and speech movements. It is\\nreferred to as apraxia of speech by organizations\\nincluding the American Speech Language Hearing\\nAssociation (ASHA).\\nA baby who does not coo or babble may display a\\nsymptom of apraxia of speech, according to ASHA. A\\nyoung child may only say a few consonant sounds, and\\nan older child may have difficulty imitating speech. An\\nadult also has this difficulty. Other symptoms include\\nsaying the wrong words. A person wants to say\\n‘‘kitchen,’’ but says ‘‘bipem’’ instead, according to an\\nASHA report.\\nA person diagnosed with apraxia may also have\\naphasia, a condition caused by damage to the brain’s\\nspeech centers. This results in difficulty reading, wit-\\nting, speaking, and understanding when others speak.\\nPost-apraxia changes\\nA person with apraxia could experience frustra-\\ntion about difficulty communicating or trouble per-\\nforming tasks. In some cases, the condition could\\naffect the person’s ability to live independently.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of apraxia could begin with testing of\\nits underlying cause. Testing for conditions like a\\nstroke or cancer includes the MRI (magnetic resonance\\nimaging) and CT scanning (computer tomography\\nscanning). Abrain biopsyis used to measure changes\\ncaused by Alzheimer’s disease. In all cases, the physi-\\ncian takes a family history. Head trauma that could\\ncause apraxia is first treated in the emergency room.\\nOther diagnostic treatment is related to identify-\\ning the type of apraxia. For example, the physician\\nmay ask the patient to demonstrate how to blow out a\\ncandle, wave, use a fork, or use a toothbrush.\\nAssessment for speech apraxia in children\\nincludes a hearing evaluation to determine if difficulty\\nin speaking is related to ahearing loss. If the condition\\nappears related to apraxia, a speech-language pathol-\\nogist examines muscle development in the jaw, lips,\\nand tongue. The examination of adults and children\\nincludes an evaluation of how words are pronounced\\nindividually and in conversation. The pathologist\\nobserves how the patient breathes when speaking\\nand the ability to perform actions like smiling.\\nThe costs of diagnosis vary because the process\\ncould include examinations and diagnostic screening\\nrelated to the underlying cost of the apraxia. Insurance\\ngenerally covers part of these costs.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment for apraxia usually involvesreha-\\nbilitation through speech-language therapy, physical\\ntherapy, or occupational therapy. In addition, treat-\\nment such as chemotherapy is administered for the\\ncondition that caused the apraxia.\\nFamily education is an important component of\\napraxia treatment. The rehabilitation process takes\\ntime, and relatives can offer encouragement and support\\nto the patient. They may be asked to help the patient\\nwith in-home exercises.

The termarbovirus stands\\nfor Arthro-pod-borne virus because these viruses are\\npassed to humans by members of the phylum\\nArthropoda (which includes insects and spiders).\\nDescription\\nOf the huge number of arboviruses known to\\nexist, about 80 types are responsible for human dis-\\nease. In addition to the virus, there are usually two\\nother types of living creatures involved in the cycle\\nleading to human disease. When large quantities of\\nvirus are present in an arthropod (often a tick or\\nmosquito), the viruses are passed to a bird or small\\nmammal when the arthropod attempts to feed on the\\nblood of that creature. The virus thrives within the\\nnew host, sometimes causing illness, sometimes not.\\nMore ticks or mosquitoes are infected with the virus\\nwhen they feed on the host’s blood. Eventually, a tick\\nor mosquito bites a human, and the virus is passed\\nalong. Just a few types of arboviruses cycle only\\nbetween arthropods and humans, with no intermedi-\\nate stop in a bird or small mammal.\\nBecause the arboviruses require an arthropod to\\npass them along to humans, the most common times\\nof year for these illnesses include summer and fall,\\nwhen mosquitoes and ticks are most prevalent.\\nDamp environments favor large populations of mos-\\nquitoes, and thus also increase the risk of arbovirus\\ninfections.\\nThe major causes of arbovirus encephalitis\\ninclude the members of the viral families alphavirus\\n(causing Eastern equine encephalitis, Western equine\\nencephalitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis), fla-\\nvivirus (responsible for St. Louis encephalitis,\\nJapanese encephalitis, Tick-borne encephalitis,\\nMurray Valley encephalitis, Russian spring-summer\\nencephalitis, and Powassan), and bunyavirus (causing\\nCalifornia encephalitis).\\nIn the United States, the most important types of\\narbovirus encephalitis include Western equine ence-\\nphalitis (WEE), Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE),\\nSt. Louis encephalitis, and California encephalitis.\\nWEE strikes young infants in particular, with a 5%\\nchance ofdeath from the illness. Of those who survive,\\nabout 60% suffer permanent brain damage. EEE\\nstrikes infants and children, with a 20% chance of\\ndeath, and a high rate of permanent brain damage\\namong survivors. St. Louis encephalitis tends to strike\\nadults older than 40 years of age, and older patients\\ntend to have higher rates of death and long-term dis-\\nability from the infection. California virus primarily\\nstrikes 5-18 year olds, with a lower degree of perma-\\nnent brain damage.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nEncephalitis occurs because specific arboviruses\\nhave biochemical characteristics which cause them to\\nbe particularly attracted to the cells of the brain and the\\nnerves. The virus causes cell death and inflammation,\\nwithfever and swelling within the brain and nerves. The\\nmembranous coverings of the brain and spinal cord\\n(the meninges) may also become inflamed, a condition\\ncalled meningitis. The brain is swollen, and patches of\\nbleeding occur throughout the brain and spinal cord.\\nPatients with encephalitis suffer from headaches,\\nfever, nausea and vomiting, stiff neck, and sleepiness.\\nAs the disease progresses, more severe symptoms\\ndevelop, including tremors, confusion, seizures,\\ncoma, and paralysis. Loss of function occurs when\\nspecific nerve areas are damaged and/or killed.\\nDiagnosis\\nEarly in the disease, laboratory testing of blood\\nmay reveal the presence of the arbovirus. The usual\\ntechnique used to verify the presence of arbovirus\\ninvolves injecting the patient’s blood into the brain\\nof a newborn mouse, then waiting to see if the mouse\\ndevelops encephalitis. Diagnosis is usually based on\\nthe patient’s symptoms, history of tick or mosquito\\nbites, and knowledge that the patient has been in an\\narea known to harbor the arbovirus.\\nKEY TERMS\\nArthropods— A phylum name referring to certain\\ninsects (including mosquitoes and ticks) and spiders.\\nEncephalitis— A condition in which the brain swells.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 391\\nArbovirus encephalitis'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 421, 'page_label': '422'}, page_content='Treatment\\nTreatment is mostly supportive, meaning it is\\ndirected at improving the symptoms, but does not\\nshorten the course of the illness.

Several drops of an essential oil can be applied\\nto a tissue or handkerchief and gently inhaled. A\\nsmall amount of essential oil can also be added to a\\nbowl of hot water and used as a steam treatment.\\nThis technique is recommended when aromatherapy\\nis used to treat respiratory and/or skin conditions.\\nAromatherapy steam devices are also available com-\\nmercially. A warm bath containing essential oils can\\nhave the same effect as steam aromatherapy, with\\nthe added benefit of promoting relaxation. When\\nused in a bath, water should be lukewarm rather\\nthan hot to slow the evaporation of the oil.\\nEssential oil diffusers, vaporizers, and light bulb\\nrings can be used to disperse essential oils over a large\\narea. These devices can be particularly effective in\\naromatherapy that uses essential oils to promote a\\nhealthier home environment. For example, eucalyptus\\nand tea tree oil are known for their antiseptic qualities\\nand are frequently used to disinfect sickrooms, and\\ncitronella and geranium can be useful in repelling\\ninsects.\\nDirect application\\nBecause of their potency, essential oils are diluted\\nin a carrier oil or lotion before being applied to the\\nskin to prevent an allergic skin reaction. The carrier oil\\ncan be a vegetable or olive based one, such as wheat\\ngerm or avocado. Light oils, such as safflower, sweet\\nalmond, grapeseed, hazelnut, apricot seed, or peach\\nkernel, may be absorbed more easily by the skin.\\nStandard dilutions of essential oils in carrier oils\\nrange from 2–10%. However, some oils can be used\\nat higher concentrations, and others should be diluted\\nfurther for safe and effective use. The type of carrier\\noil used and the therapeutic use of the application\\nmay also influence how the essential oil is mixed.\\nIndividuals should seek guidance from a healthcare\\nprofessional and/or aromatherapist when diluting\\nessential oils.\\nMassage is a common therapeutic technique\\nused in conjunction with aromatherapy to both\\nrelax the body and thoroughly administer the essen-\\ntial oil treatment. Essential oils can also be used in\\nhot or cold compresses and soaks to treat muscle\\naches and pains (e.g., lavender and ginger). As a\\nsore throat remedy, antiseptic and soothing essential\\noils (e.g., tea tree and sage) can be thoroughly\\nmixed with water and used as a gargle or\\nmouthwash.\\nInternal use\\nSome essential oils can be administered internally\\nin tincture, infusion, or suppository form to treat cer-\\ntain symptoms or conditions; however, this treatment\\nshould never be self-administered. Essential oils\\nshould only be taken internally under the supervision\\nof a qualified healthcare professional.\\nAs non-prescription botanical preparations, the\\nessential oils used in aromatherapy are typically not\\npaid for by health insurance. The self-administered\\nnature of the therapy controls costs to some degree.\\nAromatherapy treatment sessions from a profes-\\nsional aromatherapist are not covered by health\\ninsurance in most cases, although aromatherapy per-\\nformed in conjunction with physical therapy, nur-\\nsing, therapeutic massage,or other covered medical\\nservices may be.

The heartbeat can be\\ntoo slow, too fast, have extra beats, skip a beat, or\\notherwise beat irregularly.\\nDescription\\nArrhythmias are deviations from the normal\\ncadence of the heartbeat, which cause the heart to\\npump improperly. The normal heartbeat starts in the\\nright atrium, where the heart’s natural pacemaker (the\\nsinus node) sends an electrical signal to the center of\\nthe heart to the atrioventricular node. The atrioven-\\ntricular node then sends signals into the main pumping\\nchamber to make the ventricle contract. Arrhythmias\\noccur when the heartbeat starts in a part of the heart\\nother than the sinus node, an abnormal rate or rhythm\\ndevelops in the sinus node, or a heart conduction\\n‘‘block’’ prevents the electrical signal from traveling\\ndown the normal pathway.\\nMore than four million Americans have arrhyth-\\nmias, most of which are h armless. Middle-aged\\nadults commonly experience arrhythmias. As people\\nage, the probability of experiencing an arrhythmia\\nincreases. Arrhythmias often occur in people who\\ndo not have heart disease. In people with heart dis-\\nease, it is usually the heartdisease which is danger-\\nous, not the arrhythmia. Arrhythmias often occur\\nduring and after heart attacks. Some types of\\narrhythmias, such asventricular tachycardia ,a r e\\nserious and even life threatening. In the United\\nStates, arrhythmias are the primary cause ofsudden\\ncardiac death , accounting for more than 350,000\\ndeaths each year.\\nSlow heart rates (less than 60 beats per minute) are\\ncalled bradycardias, while fast heart rates (more than\\n100 beats per minute) are called tachycardias.\\nBradycardia can result in poor circulation of blood,\\nand, hence, a lack of oxygen throughout the body,\\nespecially the brain. Tachycardias also can compro-\\nmise the heart’s ability to pump effectively because the\\nventricles do not have enough time to completely fill.\\nArrhythmias are characterized by their site of\\norigin: the atria or the ventricles. Supraventricular\\narrhythmias occur in the upper areas of the heart and\\nare less serious than ventricular arrhythmias.\\nVentricular fibrillationis the most serious arrhythmia\\nand is fatal unless medical help is immediate.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn many cases, the cause of an arrhythmia is\\nunknown. Known causes of arrhythmias include\\nheart disease,stress, caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, diet\\npills, anddecongestants in cough and cold medicines.\\nSymptoms of an arrhythmia include a fast heart-\\nbeat, pounding or fluttering chest sensations, skipping\\na heartbeat, ‘‘flip-flops,’’dizziness, faintness,shortness\\nof breath, and chest pains.\\nDiagnosis\\nExamination with a stethoscope, electrocardio-\\ngrams, and electrophysiologic studies is used to diag-\\nnose arrhythmias. Sometimes arrhythmias can be\\nidentified by listening to the patient’s heart through\\na stethoscope, but, sincearrhythmias are not always\\npresent, they may not occur during the physical\\nexam.\\nKEY TERMS\\nBradycardia— A slow heart rate.

Electrodes covered with con-\\nducting jelly are placed on the patient’s chest, arms,\\nand legs. They send impulses of the heart’s activity\\nthrough an electrical activity monitor (oscilloscope)\\nto a recorder that traces them on paper. The test\\ntakes about 10 minutes and is performed in a physi-\\ncian’s office. Another type of ECG, commonly known\\nas theexercise stress test, measures how the heart and\\nblood vessels respond to exertion while the patient is\\nexercising on a treadmill or a stationary bike. This test\\nis performed in a physician’s office or an exercise\\nlaboratory and takes 15-30 minutes. Other types of\\nECGs include 24-hour ECG monitoring and trans-\\ntelephonic monitoring. In 24-hour ECG (Holter)\\nmonitoring, the patient wears a small, portable tape\\nrecorder connected to disks on his/her chest that\\nrecord the heart’s rhythm during daily activities.\\nTranstelephonic monitoring can identify arrhythmias\\nthat occur infrequently. Similar toHolter monitoring,\\ntranstelephonic monitoring can continue for days or\\nweeks, and it enables patients to send the ECG via\\ntelephone to a monitoring station when an arrhythmia\\nis felt, or the patient can store the information in the\\nrecorder and transmit it later.\\nElectrophysiologic studies are invasive proce-\\ndures performed in a hospital to identify the origin of\\nserious arrhythmias and responses to various treat-\\nments. They involvecardiac catheterization, in which\\ncatheters tipped with electrodes are passed from a vein\\nin the arm or leg through the blood vessels into the\\nheart. The electrodes record impulses in the heart,\\nhighlighting where the arrhythmia starts. During the\\nprocedure, physicians can test the effects of various\\ndrugs by provoking an arrhythmia through the elec-\\ntrodes and trying different drugs. The procedure takes\\none to three hours, during which the patient is awake\\nbut mildly sedated. Local anesthetic is injected at the\\ncatheter insertion sites.\\nTreatment\\nMany arrhythmias do not require any treatment.\\nFor serious arrhythmias, treating the underlying heart\\ndisease sometimes controls the arrhythmia. In some\\ncases, the arrhythmia itself is treated with drugs, elec-\\ntrical shock (cardioversion), automatic implantable\\ndefibrillators, artificialpacemakers, catheter ablation,\\nor surgery. Supraventricular arrhythmias often can be\\ntreated with drug therapy. Ventricular arrhythmias\\nare more complex to treat.\\nDrug therapy can manage many arrhythmias, but\\nfinding the right drug and dose requires care and can\\ntake some time. Common drugs for suppressing\\narrhythmias include beta-blockers, calcium channel\\nblockers, quinidine, digitalis preparations, and procai-\\nnamide. Because of their potential serious side effects,\\nstronger, desensitizing drugs are used only to treat life-\\nthreatening arrhythmias. All of the drugs used to treat\\narrhythmias have possible side effects, ranging from\\nmild complications with beta-blockers and calcium\\nchannel blockers to more serious effects of desensitiz-\\ning drugs that can, paradoxically, cause arrhythmias\\nor make them worse. Response to drugs is usually\\nmeasured by ECG, Holter monitor, or electrophysio-\\nlogic study.\\nIn emergency situations, cardioversion ordefibril-\\nlation (the application of an electrical shock to the\\nchest wall) is used. Cardioversion restores the heart\\nto its normal rhythm. It is followed by drug therapy to\\nprevent recurrence of the arrhythmia.\\nArtificial pacemakers that send electrical signals\\nto make the heart beat properly can be implanted\\nunder the skin during a simple operation. Leads from\\nthe pacemaker are anchored to the right side of the\\nheart. Pacemakers are used to correct bradycardia and\\nare sometimes used after surgical or catheter ablation.\\nAutomatic implantable defibrillators correct life-\\nthreatening ventricular arrhythmias by recognizing\\nthem and then restoring a normal heart rhythm by\\npacing the heart or giving it an electric shock. They\\nare implanted within the chest wall without major\\nsurgery and store information for future evaluation\\nby physicians. Automatic implantable defibrillators\\nhave proven to be more effective in saving lives than\\ndrugs alone. They often are used in conjunction with\\ndrug therapy.\\nAblation, a procedure to alter or remove the\\nheart tissue causing the arrhythmia in order to pre-\\nvent a recurrence, can be performed through a cathe-\\nt e ro rs u r g e r y .S u p r a v e n t r i c u l a rt a c h y c a r d i ac a nb e\\ntreated successfully with ablation.

Tardieu\\nand Simon viewed art therapy as an effective diagnos-\\ntic tool to identify specific types of mental illness or\\ntraumatic events. Later, psychologists would use this\\ndiagnostic aspect to develop psychological drawing\\ntests (the Draw-A-Man test, the Draw-A-Person\\nQuestionnaire [DAP.Q]) and projective personality\\ntests involving visual symbol recognition (e.g., the\\nRorschach Inkblot Test, the Thematic Apperception\\nTest [TAT], and the Holtzman Inkblot Test [HIT]).\\nThe growing popularity of milieu therapies at\\npsychiatric institutions in the twentieth century was\\nan important factor in the development of art therapy\\nin the United States.

Activities that encourage\\nself-discovery and empowerment such as art, music,\\ndance, and writing are important components of this\\napproach.\\nEducator and therapist Margaret Naumburg was\\na follower of both Freud and Jung, and incorporated\\nart into psychotherapy as a means for her patients to\\nvisualize and recognize the unconscious. She founded\\nthe Walden School in 1915, where she used students’\\nartworks in psychological counseling. She published\\nextensively on the subject and taught seminars on the\\ntechnique at New York University in the 1950s.\\nToday, she is considered the founder of art therapy\\nin the United States.\\nIn the 1930s, Karl, William, and Charles Menninger\\nintroduced an art therapy program at their Kansas-\\nbased psychiatric hospital, the Menninger Clinic. The\\nMenninger Clinic employed a number of artists in resi-\\ndence in the following years, and the facility was also\\nconsidered a leader in the art therapy movement\\nthrough the 1950s and 60s. Other noted art therapy\\npioneers who emerged in the 50s and 60s include Edith\\nKramer, Hanna Yaxa Kwiatkowska (National Institute\\nof Mental Health), and Janie Rhyne.\\nArt therapy, sometimes called expressive art or art\\npsychology, encourages self-discovery and emotional\\ngrowth. It is a two part process, involving both the\\ncreation of art and the discovery of its meaning.\\nRooted in Freud and Jung’s theories of the subcon-\\nscious and unconscious, art therapy is based on the\\nassumption that visual symbols and images are the\\nmost accessible and natural form of communication\\nto the human experience. Patients are encouraged to\\nvisualize, and then create, the thoughts and emotions\\nthat they cannot talk about. The resulting artwork is\\nthen reviewed and its meaning interpreted by the\\npatient.\\nThe ‘‘analysis’’ of the artwork produced in art\\ntherapy typically allows patients to gain some level of\\ninsight into their feelings and lets them to work\\nthrough these issues in a constructive manner. Art\\ntherapy is typically practiced with individual, group,\\nor family psychotherapy (talk therapy).

These group therapy sessions can have\\nthe added benefits of positive social interaction,\\nempathy, and support from peers. The client-artist\\ncan learn that others have similar concerns and\\nissues.\\nPreparations\\nBefore starting art therapy, the therapist may\\nhave an introductory session with the client-artist to\\ndiscuss art therapy techniques and give the client the\\nopportunity to ask questions about the process. The\\nclient-artist’s comfort with the artistic process is criti-\\ncal to successful art therapy.\\nThe therapist ensures that appropriate materials\\nand space are available for the client-artist, as well as\\nan adequate amount of time for the session.

If all or\\npart of the blockage breaks away and lodges in\\nanother part of the artery, it is called anembolism.\\nBlockage of an artery in this manner can be the result\\nof a blood clot, fat cells, or an air bubble.\\nWhen an embolus blocks the flow of blood\\nin an artery, the tissues beyond the plug are\\ndeprived of normal blood flow and oxygen. This\\ncan cause severe damage and even death of the\\ntissues involved.\\nEmboli can affect any part of the body. The most\\ncommon sites are the legs and feet. When the brain is\\naffected, it is called astroke. When the heart is\\ninvolved, it is called a heart attack or myocardial\\ninfarction (MI).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA common cause of embolus is when an artery\\nwhose lining has become thickened or damaged,\\nusually with age, allows cholesterol to build up\\nmore easily than normal on the artery wall. If\\nsome of the cholesterol breaks off, it forms an\\nembolus. Emboli also commonly form from blood\\nclots in a heart that has been damaged from heart\\nattack or when the heart contracts abnormally from\\natrial fibrillation.\\nOther known causes are fat cells that enter the\\nblood after a major bone fracture, infected blood\\ncells,cancer cells that enter the blood stream, and\\nsmall gas bubbles.\\nSymptoms of an embolus can begin suddenly or\\nbuild slowly over time, depending on the amount of\\nblocked blood flow.\\nIf the embolus is in an arm or leg, there will be\\nmuscle pain, numbness or tingling, pale skin color,\\nlower temperature in the limb, and weakness or loss\\nof muscle function. If it occurs in an internal organ,\\nthere is usually pain and/or loss of the organ’s\\nfunction.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe following tests can be used to confirm the\\npresence of an arterial embolism:\\n/C15Electrocardiogram, also known as an EKG or ECG.\\nFor this test, patches that detect electrical impulses\\nfrom the heart are attached to the chest and extremi-\\nties. The information is displayed on a monitor\\nscreen or a paper tape in the form of waves.\\nReduced blood and oxygen supply to the heart\\nshows as a change in the shape of the waves.\\n/C15Noninvasive vascular tests. These involve measuring\\nblood pressure in various parts of the body and\\ncomparing the results from each location. When\\nthere is a decrease in blood pressure beyond what is\\nnormal between two points, a blockage is presumed\\nto be present.\\n/C15Angiography. In this procedure, a colored liquid\\nmaterial (a dye, or contrast material) that can be\\nseen with x rays is injected into the blood stream\\nthrough a small tube called a catheter. As the dye\\nfills the arteries, they are easily seen on x ray motion\\npictures. If there is a blockage in the artery, it shows\\nup as a sudden cut off in the movement of contrast\\nmaterial. Angiography is an expensive procedure\\nand does carry some risk. The catheter may cause\\na blood clot to form, blocking blood flow.

Normally, oxygenated blood\\nflows to the tissue through arteries and capillaries.\\nFollowing the release of oxygen in the tissues, the\\nblood returns to the heart in veins. An arteriovenous\\nfistula is an abnormal connection of an artery and a\\nvein. The blood bypasses the capillaries and tissues, and\\nreturns to the heart. Arterial blood has a higher blood\\npressure than veins and causes swelling of veins\\ninvolved in a fistula. Although both the artery and the\\nvein retain their normal connections, the new opening\\nbetween the two will cause some arterial blood to shunt\\ninto the vein because of the blood pressure difference.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are two types of arteriovenous fistulas, con-\\ngenital and acquired. A congenital arteriovenous fis-\\ntula is one that formed during fetal development. It is a\\nbirth defect. In congenital fistulas, blood vessels of the\\nlower extremity are more frequently involved than\\nother areas of the body. Congenital fistulas are not\\ncommon. An acquired arteriovenous fistula is one that\\ndevelops after a person is born. It usually occurs when\\nan artery and vein that are side-by-side are damaged\\nand the healing process results in the two becoming\\nlinked. After catheterizations, arteriovenous fistulas\\nmay occur as a complication of the arterial puncture\\nin the leg or arm. Fistulas also form without apparent\\ncause. In the case of patients on hemodialysis, physi-\\ncians perform surgery to create a fistula. These\\npatients receive many needle sticks to flush their\\nblood through dialysis machines and for routine\\nblood analysis testing. The veins used may scar and\\nbecome difficult to use. Surgery is used to connect an\\nartery and vein so that arterial blood pressure and flow\\nrate widens the vein and decreases the chance ofblood\\nclots forming inside the vein.\\nThe main symptoms of arteriovenous fistulas near\\nthe surface of the skin are bulging and discolored\\nveins. In some cases, the bulging veins can be mistaken\\nforvaricose veins. Other fistulas can cause more seri-\\nous problems depending on their location and the\\nblood vessels involved.\\nDiagnosis\\nUsing a stethoscope, a physician can detect the\\nsound of a pulse in the affected vein (bruit). The sound\\nis a distinctive to-and-fro sound. Dye into the blood can\\nbe tracked by x ray to confirm the presence of a fistula.\\nTreatment\\nSmall arteriovenous fistulas can be corrected by\\nsurgery. Fistulas in the brain or eye are very difficult to\\ntreat. If surgery is not possible or very difficult, injec-\\ntion therapy may be used.

Lohr, PhD\\nArteriovenous malformations\\nDefinition\\nArteriovenous malformations are blood vessel\\ndefects that occur before birth when the fetus is grow-\\ning in the uterus (prenatal development). The blood\\nvessels appear as a tangled mass of arteries and veins.\\nThey do not possess the capillary (very fine blood\\nvessels) bed which normally exists in the common\\narea where the arteries and veins lie in close proximity\\n(artery-vein interface). An arteriovenous malforma-\\ntion (AVM) may hemorrhage, or bleed, leading to\\nserious complications that can be life-threatening.\\nDescription\\nAVMs represent an abnormal interface between\\narteries and veins. Normally, arteries carry oxyge-\\nnated blood to the body’s tissues through progres-\\nsively smaller blood vessels. The smallest are\\ncapillaries, which form a web of blood vessels (the\\ncapillary bed) through the body’s tissues. The arterial\\nblood moves through tissues by these tiny pathways,\\nexchanging its load of oxygen and nutrients for carbon\\ndioxide and other waste products produced by the\\nbody cells (cellular wastes). The blood is carried\\naway by progressively larger blood vessels, the veins.\\nAVMs lack a capillary bed and arterial blood is moved\\n(shunted) directly from the arteries into the veins.\\nAVMs can occur anywhere in the body and have\\nbeen found in the arms, hands, legs, feet, lungs, heart,\\nliver, and kidneys. However, 50% of these malforma-\\ntions are located in the brain, brainstem, and spinal\\ncord. Owing to the possibility of hemorrhaging, such\\nAVMs carry the risk of stroke,paralysis, and the loss\\nof speech, memory, or vision. An AVM that hemor-\\nrhages can be fatal.\\nApproximately three of every 100,000 people have\\na cerebral AVM and roughly 40-80% of them will\\nexperience some bleeding from the abnormal blood\\nvessels at some point. The annual risk of an AVM\\nbleeding is estimated at about 1-4%. After age 55, the\\nrisk of bleeding decreases. Pre-existing high blood pres-\\nsure or intense physical activity do not seem to be\\nassociated with AVM hemorrhage, butpregnancy and\\nlabor could cause a rupture or breaking open of a blood\\nvessel. An AVM hemorrhage is not as dangerous as an\\naneurysmal rupture. (An aneurysm is a swollen, blood\\nfilled vessel where the pressure of the blood causes the\\nwall to bulge outward.) There is an approximate 10%\\nfatality rate associated with AVM hemorrhage, com-\\npared to a 50% fatality rate for ruptured aneurysms.\\nAlthough AVMs are congenital defects, meaning\\na person is born with them, they are rarely discovered\\nbefore age 20. A genetic link has been proposed for\\nsome AVMs, but studies are only suggestive, not posi-\\ntive. The majority of AVMs are discovered in people\\nage 20-40. Medical researchers estimate that the mal-\\nformations are created during days 45-60 of fetal\\ndevelopment. A second theory suggests that AVMs\\nare primitive structures that are left over from the\\nKEY TERMS\\nCongenital— Present at the time of birth.\\nArteriovenous malformations.

The arteries that feed\\ninto the malformation are unusually swollen and thin\\nwalled. They lack the usual amount of smooth muscle\\ntissue and elastin, a fibrous connective tissue. These\\nblood vessels commonly accumulate deposits of cal-\\ncium salts and hyalin. The venous part of the malfor-\\nmation receives blood directly from the artery.\\nWithout the intervening capillary bed, the veins\\nreceive blood at a higher pressure than they were\\ndesigned to handle. This part of the malformation is\\nalso swollen (dilated) and thin walled. There is a mea-\\nsurable risk of an aneurysm forming near an AVM,\\nincreasing the threat of hemorrhage, brain damage,\\nand death. Approximately 10-15% of AVMs are\\naccompanied by saccular aneurysms, a type of aneur-\\nysm that looks like a small sac attached to the outer\\nwall of the blood vessel.\\nAlthough the malformation itself lacks capillaries,\\nthere is often an abnormal proliferation of capillaries\\nnext to the defect. These blood vessels feed into the\\nmalformation, causing it to grow larger in some cases.\\nAs the AVM receives more blood through this ‘‘steal,’’\\nadjacent brain tissue does not receive enough. These\\nareas show abnormal nerve cell growth, cell death,\\nand deposits of calcium in that area (calcification).\\nNerve cells within the malformation may demons-\\ntrate abnormal growth and are believed to be\\nnonfunctional.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMost people do not realize that they have an\\nAVM unless it hemorrhages enough to produce symp-\\ntoms. Small AVMs are more likely to hemorrhage. If a\\nhemorrhage occurs, it produces a sudden, severehead-\\nache. The headache may be focused in one specific\\narea or it may be more general. It can be mistaken\\nfor a migraine in some cases. The headache is accom-\\npanied by other symptoms, such asvomiting, a stiff\\nneck, sleepiness, lethargy, confusion, irritability, or\\nweakness anywhere in the body. Seizures occur in\\nabout a quarter of AVM cases. A person may experi-\\nence decreased, double, or blurred vision.\\nHemorrhaging from an AVM is generally less danger-\\nous than hemorrhaging from an aneurysm, with a\\nsurvival rate of 80-90%.\\nOther symptoms occur less frequently, but some-\\ntimes appear alongside major symptoms such as the\\nsudden severe headache. Additional warning signs of a\\nbleeding AVM are impaired speech or smell,fainting,\\nfacial paralysis, a drooping eyelid, dizziness, and ring-\\ning or buzzing in the ears.\\nAlthough large AVMs are less likely to hemor-\\nrhage, they can induce symptoms based on their mass\\nalone. Large AVMs exert pressure against brain tissue,\\ncause abnormal development in the surrounding brain\\ntissue, and slow down or block blood flow.\\nHydrocephalus, a swelling of brain tissue caused by\\naccumulated fluids, may develop. The warning signs\\nassociated with a large non-bleeding AVM are similar\\nto the symptoms of a small malformation that is bleed-\\ning. Unexplained headaches, seizures, dizziness, and\\nneurological symptoms, such as sensory changes, are\\nsignals that demand medical attention.\\nDiagnosis\\nBased on the clinical symptoms such as severe\\nheadache and neurological problems, and after a com-\\nplete neurologic exam, a computed tomography scan\\n(CT) of the head will be done. In some cases, a\\nwhooshing sound from arteries in the neck or over\\nthe eye or jaw (called a bruit), can be heard with a\\nstethoscope. The CT scan will reveal whether there has\\nbeen bleeding in the brain and can identify AVMs\\nlarger than 1 inch (2.5 cm).Magnetic resonance ima-\\nging (MRI) is also used to identify an AVM. A lumbar\\npuncture, or spinal tap, may follow the MRI or CT\\nscan. A lumbar puncture involves removing a small\\namount of cerebrospinal fluid from the lower part of\\nthe spine.

This procedure uses\\nx rays to map out the blood vessels in the brain,\\nincluding the vessels that feed into the malformation.\\nThe information gained from angiography comple-\\nments the MRI and helps distinguish the precise\\nlocation of the AVM.\\nTreatment\\nNeurosurgeons consider several factors before\\ndeciding on a treatment option. There is some debate\\nover whether or not to treat AVMs that have not\\nruptured and are not causing any symptoms. The\\nrisks and benefits of proceeding with treatment need\\nto be measured on an individual basis, taking into\\naccount factors such as the person’s age and general\\nhealth, as well as the AVM’s size and location. Several\\ntreatment options are available, both for symptomatic\\nor asymptomatic AVMs. These treatment options\\nmay be used alone or in combination.\\nSurgery\\nRemoving the AVM is the surest way of preventing\\nit from causing future problems. Both small and large\\nAVMs can be handled in surgery. Surgery is recom-\\nmended for superficial AVMs, but may be too danger-\\nous for deep or very large AVMs. Unless it is\\nan emergency situation, an AVM that has hemorrhaged\\nis treated conservatively for several weeks. Conservative\\ntreatment consists of managing the immediate symp-\\ntoms and allowing the patient’s condition to stabilize.\\nSurgery requiresgeneral anesthesiaand a longer period\\nof recuperation than any other treatment option.\\nRadiation\\nRadiation is particularly useful to treat small\\n(under 1 in) malformations that are deep within the\\nbrain. Ionizing radiation is directed at the malforma-\\ntion, destroying the AVM without damaging the sur-\\nrounding tissue. Radiation treatment is accomplished\\nin a single session and it is not necessary to open the\\nskull. However, success can only be measured over\\nthe course of the following two years. A year after\\nthe procedure, 50-75% of treated AVMs are comple-\\ntely blocked; two years after radiation treatment, the\\npercentage increases to 85-95%.\\nEmbolization\\nEmbolization involves plugging up access to the\\nmalformation. This technique does not require open-\\ning the skull to expose the brain and can be used to\\ntreat deep AVMs. Using x-ray images as a guide, a\\ncatheter is threaded through the artery in the thigh\\n(femoral artery) to the affected area. The patient\\nremains awake during the procedure and medications\\ncan be administered to prevent discomfort. The blood\\nvessel leading into the AVM is assessed for its impor-\\ntance to the rest of the brain before a balloon or other\\nblocking agent is inserted via the catheter. The block\\nchokes off the blood supply to the malformation.\\nThere may be a mild headache ornausea associated\\nwith the procedure, but patients may resume normal\\nactivities after leaving the hospital. At least two to\\nthree embolization procedures are usually necessary\\nat intervals of two to six weeks. At least a three-day\\nhospital stay is associated with each embolization.\\nPrognosis\\nApproximately 10% of AVM cases are fatal.\\nSeizures and neurological changes may be permanent\\nin another 10-30% cases of AVM rupture. If an AVM\\nbleeds once, it is about 20% likely to bleed again in the\\nnext year. As time passes from the initial hemorrhage,\\nthe risk for further bleeding drops to about 3-4%. If\\nthe AVM has not bled, it is possible, but not guaran-\\nteed, that it never will. Untreated AVMs can grow\\nlarger over time and rarely go away by themselves.\\nOnce an AVM is removed and a person has recovered\\nfrom the procedure, there should be no further symp-\\ntoms associated with that malformation.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nHenning, Mast. ‘‘Risk of Spontaneous Hemorrhage after\\nDiagnosis of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation.’’\\nThe Lancet350 (October 11, 1997): 1065.\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nAmerican Chronic Pain Association.

This fluoroscopic\\nprocedure can show the internal workings of specific\\njoints and outline soft tissue structures. The procedure\\nmay also be conducted to identify problems with the\\nligaments, cartilage, tendons, or the joint capsule of\\nthe hip, shoulder, knee, ankle or wrist. An arthrogra-\\nphy procedure may locate cysts in the joint area, eval-\\nuate problems with the joint’s arrangement and\\nfunction, or indicate the need forjoint replacement\\n(prostheses).

The\\njoint area will be cleaned and a local anesthetic\\nwill be injected into the tissues around the joint\\nto reduce pain. Next, if fluids are present in the\\njoint, the physician may suction them out (aspi-\\nrate) with a needle. These fluids may be sent to a\\nlaboratory for further study. Contrast agents are\\nthen injected into the joint through the same loca-\\ntion by attaching the aspirating needle to a syringe\\ncontaining the contrast medium. The purpose of\\ncontrast agents in x-ray procedures is to help high-\\nlight details of areas under study by making them\\nopaque. Agents for arthrography are generally air\\nand water-soluble dyes, the most common\\ncontaining iodine. Air and iodine may be used\\ntogether or independent ly. After the contrast\\nagent is administered, the site of injection will be\\nsealed and the patient may be asked to move the\\njoint around to distribute the contrast.\\nBefore the contrast medium can be absorbed by\\nthe joint itself, several films will be quickly taken\\nunder the guidance of the fluoroscope.

Two types of\\narthroplastic surgery exist. Joint resection involves\\nremoving a portion of the bone from a stiffened\\njoint, creating a gap between the bone and the socket,\\nto improve the range of motion. Scar tissue eventually\\nfills the gap.

Because of this,\\noxygen, suction, and monitoring equipment must be\\navailable. The patient’s cardiac status should always\\nbe monitored in the event that any cardiac abnormal-\\nities arise during the arthroscopy.\\nDescription\\nThe arthroscope is an instrument used to look\\ndirectly into the joint. It contains magnifying lenses\\nand glass-coated fibers that send concentrated light\\ninto the joint. A camera attached to the arthroscope\\nallows the surgeon to see a clear image of the joint.\\nThis image is then transferred to a monitor located in\\nthe operating room at the time of the arthroscopy.\\nThis video technology is also important for docu-\\nmentation of the arthroscopic procedure. For exam-\\nple, if the surgeon decides after the arthroscopic\\nexamination that a conventional approach to surgi-\\ncally expose or ‘‘open’’ the joint (arthrotomy) must\\nbe used, a good photographic record will be useful\\nwhen the surgeon returns to execute the final surgical\\nplan.\\nThe procedure requires the surgeon to make sev-\\neral small incisions (portals) through the skin’s surface\\ninto the joint. Through one or two of the portals, a\\nlarge-bore needle, called a cannula, is attached to tub-\\ning and inserted into the joint. The joint is inflated\\nwith a sterile saline solution to expand the joint and\\nensure clear arthroscopic viewing. Often, following a\\nrecent traumatic injury to a joint, the joint’s natural\\nfluid may be cloudy, making interior viewing of the\\njoint difficult. In this condition, a constant flow of the\\nsaline solution is necessary. This inflow of saline solu-\\ntion may be through the cannula with the outflow\\nthrough the arthroscope, or the positions may be\\nreversed. The arthroscope is placed through one of\\nthe portals to view and evaluate the condition of the\\njoint.\\nPreparation\\nBefore an arthroscopy can take place, the surgeon\\ncompletes a thorough medical history and evaluation.\\nImportant for the accuracy of this diagnostic\\nprocedure, a medical history and evaluation may dis-\\ncover other disorders of the joint or body parts, prov-\\ning the procedure unnecessary. This is always\\nan important preliminary step, because pain can\\noften be referred to a joint from another area of\\nthe body. Anatomical models and pictures are\\nuseful aids to explain to the patient the proposed\\narthroscopy and what the surgeon may be looking at\\nspecifically.\\nProper draping of the body part is important to\\nprevent contamination from instruments used in\\narthroscopy, such as the camera, light cords, and\\ninflow and outflow drains placed in the portals.\\nDraping packs used in arthroscopy include disposable\\npaper gowns and drapes with adhesive backing. The\\nsurgeon may also place a tourniquet above the joint to\\ntemporarily block blood flow to the area during the\\narthroscopic exam.\\nGeneral or local anesthesia may be used during\\narthroscopy. Local anesthesia is usually used\\nbecause it reduces the risk of lung and heart com-\\nplications and allows the patient to go home sooner.\\nThe local anesthetic may be injected in small\\namounts in multiple locations in skin and joint\\ntissues in a process called infiltration. In other\\ncases, the anesthetic is injected into the spinal cord\\nor a main nerve supplying the area. This process is\\ncalled a ‘‘block,’’ and it blocks all sensation below\\nthe main trunk of the nerve. For example, a femoral\\nblock anesthetizes the leg from the thigh down (its\\nname comes from femur, the thighbone). Most\\npatients are comfortable once the skin, muscles,\\nand other tissues around the joint are numbed by\\nthe anesthetic; however, some patients are also\\ngiven a sedative if they expressanxiety about the\\nprocedure.

Chronic, silent\\nhepatitis (hepatitis C) is sometimes the cause of ele-\\nvated AST. Inalcoholic hepatitis, caused by excessive\\nalcohol ingestion, AST values are usually moderately\\nelevated; in acute viral hepatitis, AST levels can rise to\\nover 20 times normal. Acute extrahepatic (outside the\\nliver) obstruction (e.g. gallstone), produces AST levels\\nthat can quickly rise to 10 times normal, and then\\nrapidly fall.

In some\\nindividuals, the infection can even invade bone and the\\nmembranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord\\n(meningitis).\\nDescription\\nAspergillosis is primarily an infection of the lungs\\ncaused by the inhalation of airborne spores of the\\nfungusAspergillus. Spores are the small particles that\\nmost fungi use to reproduce. Although virtually every-\\none is exposed to this fungus in their daily environ-\\nment, it rarely causes disease. WhenAspergillus does\\ncause disease, however, it usually occurs in those\\nindividuals with weakened immune systems (immuno-\\ncompromised) or who have a history of respiratory\\nailments. Because it does not present distinctive symp-\\ntoms, aspergillosis is generally thought to be under-\\ndiagnosed and underreported. Furthermore, many\\npatients with the more severe forms of aspergillosis\\ntend to have multiple, complex health problems, such\\nasAIDS or a blood disorder like leukemia, which can\\nfurther complicate diagnosis and treatment.\\nOnce considered particularly rare, the incidence of\\nreported aspergillosis has risen somewhat with the\\ndevelopment of more sophisticated methods of diag-\\nnosis and advances made in other areas of medicine,\\nsuch as with the increased use of certain chemother-\\napeutic and corticosteroid drugs that are extremely\\nuseful in treating various types ofcancer but that\\ndecrease the individual’s immune response, making\\nthem more susceptible to other diseases like\\naspergillosis.\\nOur advanced ability to perform tissue and organ\\ntransplants has also increased the number of people\\nvulnerable to fungal infections.

Normally functioning immune systems are\\ngenerally able to cope without consequent develop-\\nment of aspergillosis.\\nIt is important to make distinctions between the\\nvarious forms of aspergillosis, as the treatment and\\nprognosis varies considerably among types.\\nAspergillosis as a diagnosis refers to three general\\nforms:\\n/C15Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is\\nseen in patients with long-standing asthma, particu-\\nlarly in patients taking oralcorticosteroids for a long\\nperiod of time. This is usually the least serious and\\nmost treatable form.\\n/C15Aspergilloma refers to the mass formed when fungal\\nspores settle into or colonize areas of the lung that\\nhave been pitted and scarred as a result of tubercu-\\nlosis or priorpneumonia. There are several available\\ntreatments, although the success rate varies with each\\ntreatment.\\n/C15Invasive fungal infection refers to rare cases in which\\nthe fungus spreads throughout the body via the\\nblood stream and invades other organ systems.\\nOnce established, invasive fungal infections are\\nextremely difficult to cure and, as a result, the asso-\\nciateddeath rate is extremely high.\\nDiagnosis\\nAspergillosis can be quite difficult to diagnose\\nbecause the symptoms, such as coughing andwheezing,\\nif present at all, are common to many respiratory\\ndisorders. Furthermore, blood and sputum cultures\\nare not very helpful. The presence ofAspergillus is\\nso common, even in asthmatics, that a positive culture\\nalone is insufficient for a diagnosis. Other, potentially\\nmore useful, screening tools include examining the\\nsample obtained after repeatedly washing the bronchial\\ntubes of the lung with water (bronchial lavage), but\\nexamining a tissue sample (biopsy) is the most reliable\\ndiagnostic tool. Researchers are currently attempting\\nto develop a practical, specific, and rapid blood test\\nthat would confirmAspergillus infection.\\nSigns of ABPA include a worsening of bronchial\\nasthmaaccompanied by a low-grade fever. Brown flecks\\nor clumps may be seen in the sputum. Pulmonary\\nfunction tests may show decreased blood flow, suggest-\\ning an obstruction within the lungs. Elevated blood levels\\nof an antibody produced in response toAspergillusand\\nof certain immune system cells may indicate a specific\\nallergic-type immune system response.\\nA fungal mass (aspergilloma) in the lung usually\\ndoes not produce clear symptoms and is generally diag-\\nnosed when seen on chest x rays. However, 70% or\\nmore of patients spit up blood from the lungs (hemop-\\ntysis) at least once, and this may become repetitive and\\nserious. Hemoptysis, then, is another indication that\\nthe patient may be suffering from an aspergilloma.\\nIn patients with lowered immune systems who are\\nat risk for developing invasive aspergillosis, the physi-\\ncian may use a combination of blood culture with\\nvisual diagnostic techniques, such as computed tomo-\\ngraphy scans (CT) and radiography, to arrive at a\\nlikely diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment method selected depends on the\\nform of aspergillosis. ABPA can usually be treated\\nwith many of the same drugs used to treat asthma,\\nsuch as systemic steroids. Long-term therapy may be\\nrequired, however, to prevent recurrence. Antifungal\\nagents are not recommended in the treatment of\\nABPA. In cases of aspergilloma, it may become neces-\\nsary to surgically remove or reduce the size of a fungal\\nmass, especially if the patient continues to spit up\\nblood. In aspergillosis cases affecting the nose and\\nnasal sinuses, surgery may also be required.\\nIn non-ABPA cases, the use of antifungal drugs\\nmay be indicated. In such cases, amphotericin B\\n(Fungizone) is the first-line therapy. The prescribed\\ndose will depend on the patient’s condition but usually\\nbegins with a small test dose and then escalates. Less\\nthan one-third of patients are likely to respond to\\namphotericin B, and its side effects often limit its use.\\nFor patients who do not respond to oral amphotericin\\nB, another option is a different formulation of the\\nsame drug called liposomal amphotericin B.\\nFor patients who fail to respond or who cannot\\ntolerate amphotericin B, another drug called itracona-\\nzole (Sporanox), given 400-600 mg daily, has also been\\napproved. Treatment generally lasts about 3 months.\\nGiving itraconazole can produce adverse reactions if\\nprescribed in combination with certain other drugs by\\nincreasing the concentrations of both drugs in the\\nblood and creating a potentially life-threatening situa-\\ntion.

On the other hand, asthma\\naffects many patients who are not allergic in this way.\\nAsthma usually begins in childhood or adoles-\\ncence, but it also may first appear during adult years.\\nWhile the symptoms may be similar, certain important\\naspects of asthma are different in children and adults.\\nChild-onset asthma\\nNearly one-third on the 17 to 26 million\\nAmericans with asthma are children. When asthma\\nbegins in childhood, it often does so in a child who is\\nlikely, for genetic reasons, to become sensitized to\\ncommon allergens in the environment (atopic person).\\nWhen these children are exposed to house-dust mites,\\nanimal proteins, fungi, or other potential allergens,\\nthey produce a type of antibody that is intended to\\nengulf and destroy the foreign materials. This has the\\neffect of making the airway cells sensitive to particular\\nmaterials. Further exposure can lead rapidly to an\\nasthmatic response. This condition of atopy is present\\nin at least one-third and as many as one-half of the\\ngeneral population. When an infant or young child\\nwheezes during viral infections, the presence of allergy\\n(in the child or a close relative) is a clue that asthma\\nmay well continue throughout childhood.\\nAdult-onset asthma\\nAllergenic materials may also play a role when\\nadults become asthmatic. Asthma can actually start\\nat any age and in a wide variety of situations. Many\\nadults who are not allergic have conditions such as\\nsinusitis or nasal polyps, or they may be sensitive to\\naspirin and related drugs. Another major source of\\nadult asthma is exposure at work to animal products,\\ncertain forms of plastic, wood dust, or metals.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn most cases, asthma is caused by inhaling an\\nallergen that sets off the chain of biochemical and\\ntissue changes leading to airway inflammation,\\nbronchoconstriction, and wheezing. Because avoiding\\n(or at least minimizing) exposure is the most effective\\nway of treating asthma, it is vital to identify which\\nallergen or irritant is causing symptoms in a particular\\npatient. Once asthma is present, symptoms can be set\\noff or made worse if the patient also hasrhinitis\\n(inflammation of the lining of the nose) or sinusitis.\\nWhen, for some reason, stomach acid passes back up\\nthe esophagus (acid reflux), this can also make asthma\\nworse. A viral infection of the respiratory tract can\\nalso inflame an asthmatic reaction. Aspirin and a type\\nof drug called beta-blockers, often used to treat high\\nblood pressure, can also worsen the symptoms of\\nasthma.\\nThe most important inhaled allergens giving rise\\nto attacks of asthma are:\\n/C15animal dander\\n/C15mites in house dust\\n/C15fungi (molds) that grow indoors\\n/C15cockroach allergens\\n/C15pollen\\n/C15occupational exposure to chemicals, fumes, or parti-\\ncles of industrial materials in the air\\nInhaling tobacco smoke, either by smoking or\\nbeing near people who are smoking, can irritate the\\nairways and trigger an asthmatic attack. Air pollu-\\ntants can have a similar effect. In addition, there are\\nthree important factors that regularly produce attacks\\nin certain asthmatic patients, and they may sometimes\\nbe the sole cause of symptoms.

Besides\\nwheezing and being short of breath, the patient\\nmaycough and may report a feeling of ‘‘tightness’’\\nin the chest. Children may have itching on their\\nback or neck at the start of an attack. Wheezing is\\noften loudest when the patient breathes out, in an\\nattempt to expel used air through the narrowed\\nairways. Some asthmatics are free of symptoms\\nmost of the time but may occasionally be short of\\nbreath for a brief time. Others spend much of their\\ndays (and nights) coughing and wheezing, until\\nproperly treated. Crying or even laughing may\\nbring on an attack. Severe episodes are often seen\\nwhen the patient gets a viral respiratory tract infec-\\ntion or is exposed to a heavy load of an allergen or\\nirritant. Asthmatic attacks may last only a few min-\\nutes or can go on for hours or even days (a condi-\\ntion called status asthmaticus).\\nBeing short of breath may cause a patient to\\nbecome very anxious, sit upright, lean forward, and\\nuse the muscles of the neck and chest wall to help\\nbreathe. The patient may be able to say only a few\\nwords at a time before stopping to take a breath.\\nConfusion and a bluish tint to the skin are clues\\nthat the oxygen supply is much too low, and that\\nemergency treatment is needed. In a severe attack\\nthat lasts for some time, some of the air sacs in the\\nlung may rupture so that air collects within the\\nchest. This makes it even harder to breathe in\\nenough air.\\nDiagnosis\\nApart from listening to the patient’s chest, the\\nexaminer should look for maximum chest expansion\\nwhile taking in air. Hunched shoulders and contract-\\ning neck muscles are other signs of narrowed airways.\\nNasal polypsor increased amounts of nasal secretions\\nare often noted in asthmatic patients. Skin changes,\\nlikeatopic dermatitis or eczema, are a tipoff that the\\npatient has allergic problems.\\nInquiring about a family history of asthma or\\nallergies can be a valuable indicator of asthma. The\\ndiagnosis may be strongly suggested when typical\\nsymptoms and signs are present. A test called spiro-\\nmetry measures how rapidly air is exhaled and how\\nmuch is retained in the lungs. Repeating the test after\\nthe patient inhales a drug that widens the air passages\\n(a bronchodilator) will show whether the airway nar-\\nrowing is reversible, which is a very typical finding in\\nasthma. Often patients use a related instrument, called\\na peak flow meter, to keep track of asthma severity\\nwhen at home.\\nOften, it is difficult to determine what is triggering\\nasthma attacks. Allergy skin testing may be used,\\nalthough an allergic skin response does not always\\nmean that the allergen being tested is causing the\\nasthma. Also, the body’s immune system produces\\nantibody to fight off the allergen, and the amount of\\nantibody can be measured by a blood test. This will\\nshow how sensitive the patient is to a particular aller-\\ngen. If the diagnosis is still in doubt, the patient can\\ninhale a suspect allergen while using a spirometer to\\ndetect airway narrowing. Spirometry can also be\\nrepeated after a bout of exercise if exercise-induced\\nasthma is a possibility. A chest x ray will help rule\\nout other disorders.\\nTreatment\\nPatients should be periodically examined and\\nhave their lung function measured by spirometry to\\nmake sure that treatment goals are being met. These\\ngoals are to prevent troublesome symptoms, to main-\\ntain lung function as close to normal as possible, and\\nto allow patients to pursue their normal activities\\nincluding those requiring exertion. The best drug ther-\\napy is that which controls asthmatic symptoms while\\ncausing few or no side-effects.\\nDrugs\\nMETHYLXANTHINES. The chief methylxanthine\\ndrug is theophylline. It may exert some anti-inflam-\\nmatory effect, and is especially helpful in controlling\\nnighttime symptoms of asthma. When, for some rea-\\nson, a patient cannot use an inhaler to maintain long-\\nterm control, sustained-release theophylline is a good\\nalternative. The blood levels of the drug must be mea-\\nsured periodically, as too high a dose can cause an\\nabnormal heart rhythm or convulsions.\\nBETA-RECEPTOR AGONISTS. These drugs, which\\nare bronchodilators , are the best choice for relieving\\nsudden attacks of asthma and for preventing attacks\\nfrom being triggered by exercise. Some agonists, such\\nas albuterol, act mainly in lung cells and have little\\neffect on other organs, such as the heart. These\\ndrugs generally start acting within minutes, but\\ntheir effects last only four tosix hours. Longer-acting\\nbrochodilators have been developed. They may last\\nup to 12 hours. Bronchodilators may be taken in pill\\nor liquid form, but normally are used as inhalers,\\nwhich go directly to the lungs and result in fewer\\nside effects.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 427\\nAsthma'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 457, 'page_label': '458'}, page_content='STEROIDS. These drugs, which resemble natural\\nbody hormones, block inflammation and are extre-\\nmely effective in relieving symptoms of asthma.\\nWhen steroids are taken by inhalation for a long\\nperiod, asthma attacks become less frequent as the\\nairways become less sensitive to allergens. This is\\nthe strongest medicine for asthma, and can control\\neven severe cases over the long term and maintain\\ngood lung function. Steroids can cause numerous\\nside-effects, however, including bleeding from the\\nstomach, loss of calcium from bones, cataracts in\\nthe eye, and a diabetes-like state. Patients using\\nsteroids for lengthy periods may also have problems\\nwith wound healing, may gain weight, and may\\nsuffer mental problems. In children, growth may\\nbe slowed. Besides being inhaled, steroids may be\\ntaken by mouth or injected, to rapidly control\\nsevere asthma.\\nLEUKOTRIENE MODIFIERS. Leukotriene modifiers\\n(montelukast and zafirlukast) are a new type of\\ndrug that can be used in place of steroids, for\\nolder children or adults who have a mild degree of\\nasthma that persists. They work by counteracting\\nleukotrienes, which are substances released by white\\nblood cells in the lung that cause the air passages to\\nconstrict and promote mucus secretion. Leukotriene\\nmodifiers also fight off some forms of rhinitis, an\\nadded bonus for people with asthma. However, they\\nare not proven effective in fighting seasonal\\nallergies.\\nOTHER DRUGS. Cromolyn and nedocromil are\\nanti-inflammatory drugs that are often used as\\ninitial treatment to prevent asthmatic attacks over\\nthe long term in children. They can also prevent\\nattacks when given before exercise or when expo-\\nsure to an allergen cannot be avoided. These are\\nsafe drugs but are expensive, and must be taken\\nregularly even if there are no symptoms. Anti-cho-\\nlinergic drugs, such as atropine, are useful in con-\\ntrolling severe attacks when added to an inhaled\\nbeta-receptor agonist. They help widen the airways\\nand suppress mucus production.\\nIf a patient’s asthma is caused by an allergen that\\ncannot be avoided and it has been difficult to control\\nsymptoms by drugs, immunotherapy may be worth\\ntrying. Typically, increasing amounts of the allergen\\nare injected over a period of three to five years, so that\\nthe body can build up an effective immune response.\\nThere is a risk that this treatment may itself cause the\\nairways to become narrowed and bring on an asth-\\nmatic attack. Not all experts are enthusiastic about\\nimmunotherapy, although some studies have shown\\nthat it reduces asthmatic symptoms caused by\\nexposure to house-dust mites, ragweed pollen, and\\ncat dander.\\nManaging asthmatic attacks\\nA severe asthma attack should be treated as\\nquickly as possible. It is most important for a patient\\nsuffering an acute attack to be given extra oxygen.\\nRarely, it may be necessary to use a mechanical venti-\\nlator to help the patient breathe. A beta-receptor ago-\\nnist is inhaled repeatedly or continuously. If the\\npatient does not respond promptly and completely, a\\nsteroid is given. A course of steroid therapy, given\\nafter the attack is over, will make a recurrence less\\nlikely.\\nMaintaining control\\nLong-term asthma treatment is based on inhaling\\na beta-receptor agonist using a special inhaler that\\nmeters the dose. Patients must be instructed in proper\\nuse of an inhaler to be sure that it will deliver the right\\namount of drug. Once asthma has been controlled for\\nseveral weeks or months, it is worth trying to cut down\\non drug treatment, but this must be done gradually.\\nThe last drug added should be the first to be reduced.\\nPatients should be seen every one to six months,\\ndepending on the frequency of attacks.\\nStarting treatment at home, rather than in a hos-\\npital, makes for minimal delay and helps the patient to\\ngain a sense of control over the disease.

They also had a 70%\\nlower mortality rate. If more intense treatment is neces-\\nsary, it should be continued for several days. Over-the-\\ncounter ‘‘remedies’’ should be avoided. When deciding\\nwhether a patient should be hospitalized, the past his-\\ntory of acute attacks, severity of symptoms, current\\nmedication, and whether good support is available at\\nhome all must be taken into account.\\nReferral to an asthma specialist should be consid-\\nered if:\\n/C15there has been a life-threatening asthma attack or\\nsevere, persistent asthma\\n428 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAsthma'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 458, 'page_label': '459'}, page_content='/C15treatment for three to six months has not met its\\ngoals\\n/C15some other condition, such as nasal polyps or\\nchronic lung disease, is complicating asthma\\n/C15special tests, such as allergy skin testing or an aller-\\ngen challenge, are needed\\n/C15intensive steroid therapy has been necessary\\nSpecial populations\\nINFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN.

Odle\\nAstigmatism\\nDefinition\\nAstigmatism is the result of an inability of the\\ncornea to properly focus an image onto the retina.\\nThe result is a blurred image.\\nDescription\\nThe cornea is the outermost part of the eye. It is a\\ntransparent layer that covers the colored part of the eye\\n(iris), pupil, and lens. The cornea bends light and helps\\nto focus it onto the retina where specialized cells (photo\\nreceptors) detect light and transmit nerve impulses via\\nthe optic nerve to the brain where the image is formed.\\nThe cornea is dome shaped. Any incorrect shaping of\\nthe cornea results in an incorrect focusing of the light\\nthat passes through that part of the cornea. The bending\\nof light is called refraction and focusing problems with\\nthe cornea are called diseases of refraction or refractive\\ndisorders. Astigmatism is an image distortion that\\nresults from an improperly shaped cornea. Usually the\\ncornea is spherically shaped, like a baseball. However, in\\nastigmatism the cornea is elliptically shaped, more like a\\nfootball. There is a long meridian and a short meridian.\\nThese two meridians generally have a constant curva-\\nture and are generally perpendicular to each other\\n(regular astigmatism). Irregular astigmatism may have\\nmore than two meridians of focus and they may not be\\n908 apart. A point of light, therefore, going through an\\nastigmatic cornea will have two points of focus, instead\\nof one nice sharp image on the retina. This will cause the\\nperson to have blurry vision. What the blur looks like\\nwill depend upon the amount and the direction of the\\nastigmatism. A person with nearsightedness (myopia)o r\\nfarsightedness (hyperopia) may see a dot as a blurred\\ncircle. A person with astigmatism may see the same dot\\nas a blurred oval or frankfurter-shaped blur.\\nSome cases of astigmatism are caused by problems\\nin the lens of the eye. Minor variations in the curvature\\nof the lens can produce minor degrees of astigmatism\\n(lenticular astigmatism). In these patients, the cornea is\\nusually normal in shape. Infants, as a group, have the\\nleast amount of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase\\nduring childhood, as the eye is developing.\\nCornea\\nLens\\nLight\\nRetina\\nHorizontal line out of focus\\nAstigmatism corrected by lens\\nLight\\nAstigmatism can be treated by the use of cylindrical lenses.\\nThe lenses are shaped to counteract the shape of the sec-\\ntions of the cornea that are causing the difficulty.(Illustration\\nby Electronic Illustrators Group.)\\n430 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAstigmatism'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 460, 'page_label': '461'}, page_content='Causes and symptoms\\nThe main symptom of astigmatism is blurring.\\nPeople can also experience headaches and eyestrain.\\nParents can notice that a child may have astigma-\\ntism when the child can see some part of a pattern\\nor picture more clearly than others. For example,\\nlines going across may seem clearer than lines going\\nup and down.\\nRegular astigmatism can be caused by the weight\\nof the upper eyelid resting on the eyeball creating\\ndistortion, surgical incisions in the cornea, trauma or\\nscarring to the cornea, the presence of tumors in the\\neyelid, or a developmental factor. Irregular astigma-\\ntism can be caused by scarring or keratoconus.\\nKeratoconus is a condition in which the cornea thins\\nand becomes cone shaped. It usually occurs around\\npubertyand is more common in women. Although the\\ncauses of keratoconus are unknown, it may be heredi-\\ntary or a result of chronic eye rubbing, as in people\\nwith allergies. The center of the cone may not be in line\\nwith the center of the cornea. Diabetes can play a role\\nin the development of astigmatism. High blood sugar\\nlevels can cause shape changes in the lens of the eye.\\nThis process usually occurs slowly and, often, is only\\nnoticed when the diabetic has started treatment to\\ncontrol their blood sugar. The return to a more normal\\nblood sugar allows the lens to return to normal and\\nthis change is sometimes noticed by the patient as\\nfarsightedness. Because of this, diabetics should wait\\nuntil their blood sugar is under control for at least one\\nmonth to allow vision to stabilize before being mea-\\nsured for eyeglasses.\\nDiagnosis\\nPatients seek treatment because of blurred vision.\\nA variety of tests can be used to detect astigmatism\\nduring the eye exam. The patient may be asked to\\ndescribe the astigmatic dial, a series of lines that radi-\\nate outward from a center. People with astigmatism\\nwill see some of the lines more clearly than others.\\nOne diagnostic instrument used is the keratometer.\\nThis measures the curvature of the central cornea.\\nIt measures the amount and direction of the curvature.\\nA corneal topographer can measure a larger area of\\nthe cornea. It can measure the central area and\\nmid-periphery of the cornea. A keratoscope projects\\na series of concentric light rings onto the cornea.\\nMisshapen areas of the cornea are revealed by noting\\nareas of the light pattern that do not appear con-\\ncentric on the cornea. Because these instruments are\\nmeasuring the cornea, it is also important to have a\\nrefraction in case the lens is also contributing to the\\nastigmatism. The refraction measures the optics or\\nvisual status of the eye and the result is the eyeglass\\nprescription. The refraction is when the patient is look-\\ning at an eye chart and the doctor is putting different\\nlenses in front of the patient’s eyes and asks which one\\nlooks better.\\nTreatment\\nAstigmatism can be treated by the use of cylind-\\nrical lenses. They can be in eyeglasses or contact lenses.\\nThe unit of measure describing the power of the lens\\nsystem or lens is called the diopter (D). The lenses are\\nshaped to counteract the shape of the sections of\\ncornea that are causing the difficulty. Because the\\ncorrection is in one direction, it is written in terms of\\nthe axis the correction is in. On a prescription, for\\nexample, it may say-1.00 /C21808. Cylinders correct\\nastigmatism, minus spheres correct myopia, and plus\\nspheres correct hyperopia.\\nThere is some debate as to whether people with\\nvery small amounts of astigmatism should be treated.\\nGenerally, if visual acuity is good and the patient\\nexperiences no overt symptoms, treatment is not\\nnecessary. When treating larger amounts of astigma-\\ntism, or astigmatism for the first time, the doctor may\\nnot totally correct the astigmatism. The cylindrical\\ncorrection in the eyeglasses may make the floor appear\\nto tilt, thus making it difficult for the patient at first.\\nGenerally, the doctor will place lenses in a trial frame\\nto allow the patient to try the prescription at the exam.\\nIt may take a week or so to get used to the glasses,\\nhowever, if the patient is having a problem they should\\ncontact their doctor, who might want to recheck the\\nprescription.\\nContact lenses that are used to correct astigma-\\ntism are called toric lenses.

This is done through massage, alteration\\nof the environment, and fitness training.\\nDescription\\nSeeking to solve movement problems, Aston-\\nPatterning helps make the most of their own unique\\nbody types rather than trying to force them to conform\\nto an ideal. UnlikeRolfing, it doesn’t strive for linear\\nsymmetry. Rather it works with asymmetry in the\\nhuman body to develop patterns of alignment and\\nmovement that feel right to the individual. Aston\\nalso introduced the idea of working in a three-dimen-\\nsional spinal pattern. Aston-Patterning sessions have\\nfour general components.

She\\ngraduated from University of California at Los Angeles\\nwith a B.A. and a M.F.A. in dance. Her interest in move-\\nment arose from working as a dancer. In 1963 Aston\\nestablished her first movement education program for\\ndancers, actors, and athletes at Long Beach City College.\\nFive years later, while recovering from injuries sus-\\ntained during two consecutive automobile accidents,\\nAston met Ida Rolf, the developer of Rolfing. Aston\\nbegan working for Rolf, teaching a movement education\\nprogram called Rolf-Aston Structural Patterning that\\nemphasized using the body with minimum effort and\\nmaximum precision.\\nIn time, Rolf and Aston’s views on movement diverged,\\nand the partnership was dissolved in 1977. Aston formed her\\nown company called the Aston Paradigm Corporation in\\nLake Tahoe, California. This company provides training\\nand certification for Aston practitioners. She also began\\nexploring how environmental conditions affect body\\nmovement, foreshadowing the ergonomic movement in\\nthe workplace that developed in the 1990s. Over time,\\nAston has expanded her movement work to include a\\nfitness program for older adults.

A-T also affects the\\nimmune system and increases the risk of leukemia\\nand lymphoma in affected individuals.\\nDescription\\nThe disorder first appeared in the medical litera-\\nture in the mid-1920s, but was not named specifically\\nuntil 1957. The name is a combination of two recog-\\nnized abnormalities: ataxia (lack of muscle control)\\nand telangiectasia (abnormal dilatation of capillary\\nvessels that often result in tumors and redskin lesions).\\nHowever, A-T involves more than just the sum of\\nthese two findings. Other associated A-T problems\\ninclude immune system deficiencies, extreme sensitiv-\\nity to radiation, and blood cancers.\\nMedical researchers initially suspected that multi-\\nple genes (the units responsible for inherited features)\\nwere involved. However, in 1995, mutations in a single\\nlarge gene were identified as causing A-T. Researchers\\nnamed the gene ATM for A-T, mutated. Subsequent\\nresearch revealed that ATM has a significant role in\\nregulating cell division. The symptoms associated with\\nA-T reflect the main role of the AT gene, which is to\\ninduce several cellular responses to DNA damage,\\nsuch as preventing damaged DNA from being repro-\\nduced.

This condition prevents normal\\noxygen absoption to healthy tissues.\\nDescription\\nAtelectasis can result from an obstruction (block-\\nage) of the airways that affects tiny air scas called\\nalveoli. Alveoli are very thin-walled and contain a\\nrich blood supply. They are important for lung func-\\ntion, since their purpose is the exchange of oxygen and\\ncarbon dioxide. When the airways are blocked by a\\nmucous ‘‘plug,’’ foreign object, or tumor, the alveoli\\nare unable to fill with air and collapse of lung tissue\\ncan occur in the affected area. Atelectasis is a potential\\ncomplication following surgery, especially in indivi-\\nduals who have undergone chest or abdominal opera-\\ntions resulting in associated abdominal or chestpain\\nduring breathing. Congenital atelectasis can result\\nfrom a failure of the lungs to expand at birth. This\\ncongenital condition may be localized or may affect all\\nof both lungs.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses of atelectasis include insufficient attemps\\nat respiration by the newborn, bronchial obstruction,\\nor absence ofsurfactant (a substance secreted by\\nalveoli that maintains the stability of lung tissue by\\nreducing the surface tension of fluids that coat the\\nlung). This lack of surfactant reduces the surface\\narea available for effective gas exchange causing it to\\ncollapse if severe. Pressure on the lung from fluid or air\\ncan cause atelectasis as well as obstruction of lung air\\npassages by thick mucus resulting from various infec-\\ntions and lung diseases. Tumors and inhaled objects\\ncan also cause obstruction of the airway, leading to\\natelectasis.\\nAnyone undergoing chest or abdominal surgery\\nusing general anesthesiais at risk to develop atelecta-\\nsis, since breathing is often shallow after surgery to\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 435\\nAtelectasis'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 465, 'page_label': '466'}, page_content='avoid pain from the surgical incision. Any significant\\ndecrease in airflow to the alveoli contributes to pool-\\ning of secretions, which in turn can cause infection.\\nChest injuries causing shallow breathing, including\\nfractured ribs, can cause atelectasis. Common symp-\\ntoms of atelectasis includeshortness of breath and\\ndecreased chest wall expansion. If atelectasis only\\nafects a small area of the lung, symptoms are ususally\\nminimal. If the condition affects a large area of the\\nlung and develops quickly, the individual may turn\\nblue (cyanotic) or pale, have extreme shortness of\\nbreath, and feel a stabbing pain on the affected side.\\nFeverand increased heart rate may be present if infec-\\ntion accompanies atelectasis.\\nDiagnosis\\nTo diagnose atelectasis, a doctor starts by record-\\ning the patient’s symptoms and performing a tho-\\nroughphysical examination. When the doctor listens\\nto the lungs through a stethoscope (ausculation),\\ndiminished or bronchial breath sounds may be heard.\\nBy tapping on the chest (percussion) while listening\\nthrough the stethoscope, the doctor can often tell if the\\nlung is collapsed. Achest x raythat shows an airless\\narea in the lung confirms the diagnosis of atelectasis. If\\nan obstruction of the airways is suspected, a computed\\ntomography scan (CT) orbronchoscopy may be\\nperformed to locate the cause of the blockage.\\nTreatment\\nIf atelectasis is due to obstruction of the airway,\\nthe first step in treatment is to remove the cause of\\nthe blockage. This may be done by coughing, suction-\\ning, or bronchoscopy. If a tumor is the cause of atelec-\\ntasis, surgery may be necessary to remove it.\\nAntibioticsare commonly used to fight the infection\\nthat often accompanies atelectasis. In cases where\\nrecurrent or long-lasting infection is disabling or\\nwhere significant bleeding occurs, the affected section\\nof the lung may be surgically removed.\\nPrognosis\\nIf atelectasis is caused by a thick mucus ‘‘plug’’ or\\ninhaled foreign object, the patient usually recovers com-\\npletely when the blockage is removed. If it is caused by a\\ntumor, the outcome depends on the nature of the tumor\\ninvolved. If atelectasis is a result of surgery, other post-\\noperative conditions and/or complications affect the\\nprognosis.\\nA computed tomography (CT) scan through a patient’s chest.\\nThe collapsed lung appears at the right of the image.

It may be done on\\npatients with chest pain who have not responded to\\nother medical therapy and on certain of those who are\\ncandidates for balloonangioplasty (a surgical proce-\\ndure in which a balloon catheter is used to flatten\\nplaque against an artery wall) or coronary artery\\nbypass graft surgery. It is sometimes performed to\\nremove plaque that has built up after acoronary artery\\nbypass graft surgery.\\nPrecautions\\nAtherectomy should not be performed when the\\nplaque is located where blood vessels divide into\\nbranches, when plaque is angular or inside an angle\\nof a blood vessel, on patients with weak vessel walls,\\non ulcerated or calcium-hardened lesions, or on\\nblockages through which a guide wire won’t pass.\\nDescription\\nAtherectomy uses a rotating shaver or other device\\nplaced on the end of a catheter to slice away or destroy\\nplaque. At the beginning of the procedure, medications\\nto control blood pressure, dilate the coronary arteries,\\nand preventblood clotsare administered. The patient is\\nawake but sedated. The catheter is inserted into an\\nartery in the groin, leg, or arm, and threaded through\\nthe blood vessels into the blocked coronary artery. The\\ncutting head is positioned against the plaque and acti-\\nvated, and the plaque is ground up or suctioned out.\\nThe types of atherectomy are rotational, direc-\\ntional, and transluminal extraction. Rotational ather-\\nectomy uses a high speed rotating shaver to grind up\\nplaque. Directional atherectomy was the first type\\napproved, but is no longer commonly used; it scrapes\\nplaque into an opening in one side of the catheter.\\nTransluminal extraction coronary atherectomy uses a\\ndevice that cuts plaque off vessel walls and vacuums it\\ninto a bottle.

In Greek,athere means\\ngruel, andskleros means hard. Atherosclerosis is often\\ncalled arteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis (from the\\nGreek arteria, meaning artery) is a general term for\\nhardening of the arteries. Arteriosclerosis can occur in\\nseveral forms, including atherosclerosis.\\nDescription\\nAtherosclerosis, a progressive process responsible\\nfor most heart disease, is a type of arteriosclerosis\\nor hardening of the arteries. An artery is made up of\\nseveral layers: an inner lining called the endothelium,\\nan elastic membrane that allows the artery to expand\\nand contract, a layer of smooth muscle, and a layer of\\nconnective tissue. Arteriosclerosis is a broad term that\\nincludes a hardening of the inner and middle layers of\\nthe artery. It can be caused by normalaging, by high\\nblood pressure, and by diseases such as diabetes.\\nAtherosclerosis is a type of arteriosclerosis that affects\\nonly the inner lining of an artery. It is characterized by\\nplaque deposits that block the flow of blood.\\nPlaque is made of fatty substances, cholesterol,\\nwaste products from the cells, calcium, and fibrin, a\\nstringy material that helps clot blood. The plaque for-\\nmation process stimulates the cells of the artery wall to\\nproduce substances that accumulate in the inner layer.\\nFat builds up within these cells and around them, and\\nthey form connective tissue and calcium. The inner\\nlayer of the artery wall thickens, the artery’s diameter\\nis reduced, and blood flow and oxygen delivery are\\ndecreased. Plaques can rupture or crack open, causing\\nthe sudden formation of a blood clot (thrombosis).\\nAtherosclerosis can cause aheart attackif it completely\\nblocks the blood flow in the heart (coronary) arteries. It\\ncan cause astroke if it completely blocks the brain\\n(carotid) arteries. Atherosclerosis can also occur in the\\narteries of the neck, kidneys, thighs, and arms, causing\\nkidney failure organgrene and amputation.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAtherosclerosis can begin in the late teens, but it\\nusually takes decades to cause symptoms. Some people\\nexperience rapidly progressing atherosclerosis during\\ntheir thirties, others during their fifties or sixties.\\nAtherosclerosis is complex. Its exact cause is still\\nunknown. It is thought that atherosclerosis is caused\\nby a response to damage to the endothelium from high\\ncholesterol, high blood pressure, and cigarettesmoking.\\nA person who has all three of these risk factors is eight\\ntimes more likely to develop atherosclerosis than is a\\nperson who has none. Physical inactivity, diabetes, and\\nobesity are also risk factors for atherosclerosis. High\\nlevels of the amino acidhomocysteine and abnormal\\nlevels of protein-coated fats called lipoproteins also\\nraise the risk ofcoronary artery disease. These sub-\\nstances are the targets of much current research. The\\nrole of triglycerides, another fat that circulates in the\\nblood, in forming atherosclerotic plaques is unclear.\\nHigh levels of triglycerides are often associated with\\ndiabetes,obesity, and low levels of high-density lipo-\\nproteins (HDL cholesterol). The more HDL (‘‘good’’)\\ncholesterol, in the blood, the less likely is coronary\\nartery disease. These risk factors are all modifiable.\\nNon-modifiable risk factors are heredity, sex, and age.\\nRisk factors that can be changed:\\n/C15Cigarette/tobacco smoke–Smoking increases both\\nthe chance of developing atherosclerosis and the\\nchance of dying from coronary heart disease.\\nSecond hand smoke may also increase risk.\\n/C15High blood cholesterol–Cholesterol, a soft, waxy\\nsubstance, comes from foods such as meat, eggs,\\nand other animal products and is produced in the\\nliver. Age, sex, heredity, and diet affect cholesterol.\\nTotal blood cholesterol is considered high at levels\\nabove 240 mg/dL and borderline at 200-239 mg/dL.\\nHigh-risk levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL\\ncholesterol) begin at 130-159 mg/dL.\\n/C15High triglycerides–Most fat in food and in the body\\ntakes the form of triglycerides. Blood triglyceride\\nlevels above 400 mg/dL have been linked to coronary\\nartery disease in some people. Triglycerides, how-\\never, are not nearly as harmful as LDL cholesterol.\\n/C15High blood pressure–Blood pressure of 140 over 90\\nor higher makes the heart work harder, and over\\ntime, both weakens the heart and harms the arteries.\\n/C15Physical inactivity–Lack of exercise increases the\\nrisk of atherosclerosis.\\n/C15Diabetes mellitus–The risk of developing atherosclero-\\nsis is seriously increased for diabetics and can be low-\\nered by keeping diabetes under control.

The balloon is inflated, compresses the plaque\\nto enlarge the blood vessel, and opens the blocked\\nartery. Coronary angioplasty is performed by a cardi-\\nologist in a hospital and generally requires a hospital\\nstay of one or two days. It is successful about 90% of\\nthe time, but for one-third of patients the artery nar-\\nrows again within six months. It can be repeated and a\\n‘‘stent’’ may be placed in the artery to help keep it open\\n(see below).\\nIn coronary artery bypass surgery (bypass sur-\\ngery), a detour is built around the blockage with a\\nhealthy vein or artery, which then supplies oxygen-\\nrich blood to the heart. It is major surgery appropriate\\nfor patients with blockages in two or three major\\ncoronary arteries or severely narrowed left main cor-\\nonary arteries, and for those who have not responded\\nto other treatments. It is performed in a hospital under\\ngeneral anesthesiaand uses a heart-lung machine.\\nAbout 70% of patients experience full relief; about\\n20% partial relief.\\nThree other semi-experimental surgical proce-\\ndures may be used to treat atherosclerosis.

In fact, it’s so common\\nthat most people will have at least one episode at least\\nonce in their lives. It’s less often found in women and\\nchildren under age 12.

Turkington\\nAthletic heart syndrome\\nDefinition\\nAthletic heart syndrome is the adaptation of\\nan athlete’s heart in response the physiologic stresses\\nof strenuous physical training. It can be difficult to\\ndistinguish a significant medical condition from an\\nathletic heart.\\nDescription\\nThe heart adapts to physical demands by enlar-\\nging, especially the left ventricle. Enlargement increases\\nthe cardiac output, the amount of blood pumped with\\neach beat of the heart. The exact type of adaptation\\ndepends on the nature of the physical demand. There\\nare two types of demand, static and dynamic. Static\\ndemand involves smaller groups of muscles under\\nextreme resistance for brief period. An example is\\nweight lifting. Dynamic training involves larger groups\\nof muscles at lower resistance for extended periods of\\ntime. Examples are aerobic training and tennis.\\nCardiac enlargement is associated with dynamic train-\\ning. The heart’s response to static training is hypertro-\\nphy, thickening of the muscle walls of the heart. As\\nthe wall of the heart adapts, there are changes in the\\nelectrical conducting system of the heart. Because of\\nthe larger volume of blood being pumped with each\\nheart beat, the heart rate when at rest decreases\\nbelow the normal level for nonathletes.\\nSudden unexpecteddeath (SUD) is the death of an\\nathlete, usually during or shortly after physical acti-\\nvity. Often, there is no warning that the person will\\nexperience SUD, although in some cases, warning\\nsigns appear which cause the person to seek medical\\nadvice. Importantly, cases of death occurring during\\nphysical activity are not caused by athletic heart\\nsyndrome, but by undiagnosed heart disorders.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAthletic heart syndrome is the consequence of a\\nnormal adaptation by the heart to increased physical\\nactivity. The changes in the electrical conduction sys-\\ntem of the heart may be pronounced and diagnostic,\\nbut should not cause problems. In the case of SUD,\\nother heart problems are involved. In 85-97% of the\\ncases of SUD, an underlying structural defect of the\\nheart has been noted.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe changes in the heart beat caused by the elec-\\ntrical conduction system of the heart are detectable on\\nan electrocardiogram. Many of the changes seen in\\nathletic heart syndrome mimic those of various heart\\ndiseases. Careful examination must be made to distin-\\nguish heart disease from athletic heart syndrome.\\nPrognosis\\nThe yearly rate for occurrence of SUD in people\\nless than 35 years of age is less than 7 incidents per\\n100,000. Of all SUD cases, only about 8% areexercise\\nrelated. On a national basis, this means that each year\\napproximately 25 athletes experience SUD. In persons\\nover age 35, the incidence of SUD is approximately 55\\nin 100,000, with only 3% of the cases occurring during\\nexercise.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAlexander, R. W., R. C. Schlant, and V.

It emphasizes meat,\\ncheese, and eggs, while discouraging foods such as\\nbread, pasta, fruit, and sugar. It is a form of keto-\\ngenic diet.\\nPurpose\\nThe primary benefit of the diet is rapid and sub-\\nstantial weight loss. By restricting carbohydrate\\nintake, the body will burn more fat stored in the\\nbody. Since there are no limits on the amount of\\ncalories or quantities of foods allowed on the diet,\\nthere is little hunger between meals. According to\\nAtkins, the diet can alleviate symptoms of conditions\\nsuch asfatigue, irritability, headaches, depression, and\\nsome types of joint and musclepain.\\nDescription\\nThe regimen is a low-carbohydrate, or ketogenic\\ndiet, characterized by initial rapid weight loss, usually\\ndue to water loss. Drastically reducing the amount of\\ncarbohydrate intake causes liver and muscle glycogen\\nloss, which has a strong but temporary diuretic effect.\\nLong-term weight loss occurs because with a low\\namount of carbohydrate intake, the body burns stored\\nfat for energy.\\nThe four-step diet starts with a two-week induc-\\ntion program designed to rebalance an individual’s\\nmetabolism. Unlimited amounts of fat and protein\\nare allowed but carbohydrate intake is restricted to\\n20 grams per day. Foods allowed include butter, oil,\\nmeat, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese, and cream. The daily\\namount of carbohydrates allowed equals about three\\ncups of salad vegetables, such as lettuce, cucumbers,\\nand celery.\\nThe second stage is for ongoing weight loss. It\\nallows 20-40 grams of carbohydrates a day. When\\nthe individual is about 10 pounds from their desired\\nweight, they begin the pre-maintenance phase. This\\ngradually adds one to three servings a week of high\\ncarbohydrate foods, such as a piece of fruit or slice of\\nwhole-wheat bread. When the desired weight is\\nreached, the maintenance stage begins. It allows\\n40-60 grams of carbohydrates per day.\\nOpinion from the general medical community\\nremains mixed on the Atkins diet. There have been\\nno significant long-term scientific studies on the diet.\\nA number of leading medical and health organiza-\\ntions, including the American Medical Association,\\nAmerican Dietetic Association (ADA), and the\\nAmerican Heart Association oppose it. It is drastically\\ndifferent than the dietary intakes recommended by the\\nU.S. Department of Agriculture and the National\\nInstitutes of Health. Much of the opposition is because\\nthe diet is lacking in somevitamins and nutrients, and\\nbecause it is high in fat. In a hearing before the U.S.\\nCongress on February 24, 2000, an ADA representa-\\ntive called the Atkins diet ‘‘hazardous’’ and said it\\nlacked scientific credibility.\\nPreparations\\nNo advance preparation is needed to go on the\\ndiet. However, as with mostdiets, it is generally con-\\nsidered appropriate to consult with a physician and to\\nhave a physical evaluation before starting such a nutri-\\ntional regimen. The evaluation should include blood\\ntests to determine levels of cholesterol, triglycerides,\\nglucose, insulin, and uric acid. A glucose tolerance test\\nis also recommended.\\nPrecautions\\nAdherence to the Atkins diet can result in vitamin\\nand mineral deficiencies. In his books, Atkins recom-\\nmends a wide-range ofnutritional supplements, includ-\\ning a multi-vitamin. Among his recommendations,\\nAtkins suggests the following daily dosages: 300-600\\nmicrograms (mcg) of chromium picolinate, 100-400\\nmilligrams (mg) of pantetheine, 200 mcg of selenium,\\nand 450-675 mcg of biotin.\\nThe diet is not recommended for lacto-ovo vege-\\ntarians, since it cannot be done as successfully without\\nprotein derived from animal products. Also, vegans\\ncannot follow this diet, since a vegan diet is too high in\\ncarbohydrates, according to Atkins. Instead, he\\nrecommends vegetarians with a serious weight pro-\\nblem give upvegetarianism, or at least include fish in\\ntheir diet.\\nSide effects\\nAccording to Atkins, the diet causes no adverse\\nside effects. Many health care professionals dis-\\nagree. In a fact sheet for the Healthcare Reality\\nCheck Web site (<http://www.hcrc.org>), Ellen\\nColeman, a registered dietician and author, said\\nthe diet may have serious side effects for some peo-\\nple.

Wells\\nAtopic dermatitis\\nDefinition\\nEczema is a general term used to describe a variety\\nof conditions that cause an itchy, inflamed skin\\nrash. Atopicdermatitis, a form of eczema, is a non-\\ncontagious disorder characterized by chronically\\ninflamed skin and sometimes intolerable itching.\\nDescription\\nAtopic dermatitis refers to a wide range of dis-\\neases that are often associated with stress and allergic\\ndisorders that involve the respiratory system, like\\nasthmaand hay fever. Although atopic dermatitis\\ncan appear at any age, it is most common in children\\nand young adults. Symptoms usually abate before the\\nage of 25 and do not affect the patient’s general health.\\nAbout one in ten babies develop a form of atopic\\ndermatitis called infantile eczema. Characterized by skin\\nthatoozesand becomes encrusted, infantile eczema most\\noften occurs on the face and scalp. The condition usually\\nimproves before the child’ssecond birthday,andmedical\\nattention can keep symptoms in check until that time.\\nWhen atopic dermatitis develops after infancy,\\ninflammation, blistering, oozing, and crusting are less\\npronounced. The patient’s sores become dry, turn from\\nred to brownish-gray, and skin may thicken and become\\nscaly. In dark-skinned individuals, this condition can\\ncause the complexion to lighten or darken.Itchingasso-\\nciated with this condition is usually worst at night. It\\ncan be so intense that patients scratch until their sores\\nbleed, sometimes causing scarring and infection.\\nAtopic dermatitis affects about 3% of the popula-\\ntion of the United States, and about 80% of the people\\nwho have the condition have one or more relatives with\\nthe same condition or a similar one. Symptoms tend to\\nbe most severe in females. Atopic dermatitis can erupt on\\nany part of the skin, and crusted, thickened patches on\\nthe fingers, palms, or the soles of the feet can last for\\nyears. In teenagers and young adults, atopic dermatitis\\noften appears on one or more of the following areas:\\n/C15elbow creases\\n/C15backs of the knees\\n/C15ankles\\n/C15wrists\\n/C15face\\n/C15neck\\n/C15upper chest\\n/C15palms and between the fingers\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhile allergic reactions often trigger atopic\\ndermatitis, the condition is thought to be the result\\nof an inherited over-active immune system or a\\ngenetic defect that causes the skin to lose abnor-\\nmally large amounts of moisture.

AEB\\nmay also be the result of an enlarged atria, lung dis-\\nease, or the result of reduced blood supply to that area\\nof the heart.\\nIf a person is aware of the event, the first symptom\\nof AEB is usually a feeling that the heart has skipped\\nor missed a beat. This is often accompanied by a\\nfeeling that the heart is thumping or pounding in the\\nchest.

In atrial fibrillation, the atria\\n‘‘quiver’’ chaotically and the ventricles beat irregu-\\nlarly. In atrial flutter, the atria beat regularly and\\nfaster than the ventricles.\\nDescription\\nAtrial fibrillation and flutter are two types of\\ncardiac arrhythmias, irregularities in the heart’s\\nrhythm. Nearly 2 million Americans have atrial fibril-\\nlation, according to the American Heart Association.\\nIt is the most common chronic arrhythmia. Atrial\\nflutter is less common, but both of these arrhythmias\\ncan cause a blood clot to form in the heart. This can\\nlead to astroke or a blockage carried by the blood flow\\n(an embolism) anywhere in the body’s arteries. Atrial\\nfibrillation is responsible for about 15% of strokes.\\nThe atria are the heart’s two small upper cham-\\nbers. In atrial fibrillation, the heart beat is comple-\\ntely irregular. The atrial muscles contract very\\nquickly and irregularly; the ventricles, the heart’s\\ntwo large lower chambers, beat irregularly but not\\nas fast as the atria. When the atria fibrillate, blood\\nthat is not completely pumped out can pool and\\nform a clot. In atrial flutter, the heart beat is\\nusually very fast but steady. The atria beat faster\\nthan the ventricles.\\nAtrial fibrillation often occurs in people with var-\\nious types of heart disease. Atrial fibrillation may also\\nresult from an inflammation of the heart’s covering\\n(pericarditis), chest trauma or surgery, pulmonary dis-\\nease, and certain medications. Atrial fibrillation is\\nmore common in older people; about 10% of people\\nover the age of 75 have it. Atrial flutter and fibrillation\\nusually occur in people with hypertensive or coronary\\nheart disease and other types of heart disorders.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn most cases, the cause of atrial fibrillation and\\nflutter can be found, but often it cannot.

Atrial fibrillation and flutter\\nare usually diagnosed through electrocardiography\\n(EKGs), anexercise stress test, a 24-hour Holter\\nEKG monitor, or a telephone cardiac monitor. An\\nEKG shows the heart’s activity and may reveal a\\nlack of oxygen (ischemia). Electrodes covered with\\nconducting jelly are placed on the patient’s chest,\\narms, and legs. The electrodes send impulses of the\\nheart’s activity through a monitor (called an oscillo-\\nscope) to a recorder that traces the pattern of the\\nimpulses onto paper. The test takes about 10 minutes\\nand is performed in a doctor’s office. The exercise\\nstress test measures how the heart and blood vessels\\nrespond to work when the patient is exercising on a\\ntreadmill or a stationary bike. This test is performed in\\na doctor’s office within an exercise laboratory and\\ntakes 15-30 minutes.\\nIn 24-hour EKG (Holter) monitoring, the\\npatient wears a small, portable tape recorder con-\\nnected to disks on his/her chest that record the\\nheart’s rhythm during normal activities. An EKG\\ncalled transtelephonic monitoring identifies arrhyth-\\nmias that occur infrequently. LikeHolter monitor-\\ning, transtelephonic monitoring continues for days\\nor weeks and enables patients to send the EKG via\\ntelephone to a monitoring station when an arrhythmia\\nis felt, or to store the information in the recorder and\\ntransmit it later. Doctors can also use high-frequency\\nsound waves (echocardiography) to determine the\\nstructure and function of the heart. This diagnostic\\nmethod is often helpful to evaluate for underlying\\nheart disease.\\nTreatment\\nAtrial fibrillation and flutter are usually treated\\nwith medications and/or electrical shock (cardiover-\\nsion). In some cases, removal of a small portion of the\\nheart (ablation), implantation of a pacemaker or a\\ncardioverter defibrillator, or maze surgery is needed.\\nIf the heart rate cannot be quickly controlled,\\nelectrical cardioversion may be used. Cardioversion,\\nthe electric shock to the chest wall, is usually per-\\nformed emergencies. This device briefly suspends the\\nheart’s activity and allows it to return to a normal\\nrhythm.\\nAblation destroys the heart tissue that causes the\\narrhythmia. The tissue can be destroyed by catheter-\\nization or surgery. Radiofrequency catheter ablation,\\nperformed in acardiac catheterizationlaboratory, can\\ncure atrial flutter and control the heart rate in atrial\\nfibrillation. The patient is awake but sedated. A thin\\ntube called a catheter is inserted into a vein and is\\nthreaded into the heart. At the end of the catheter, a\\ndevice maps the electrical pathways of the heart. A\\ncardiologist, a doctor specializing in the heart, uses\\nthis map to identify the pathway(s) causing the\\narrhythmia, and then eliminates it (them) with bursts\\nof high-frequency radio waves. Surgical ablation is\\nperformed in an operating room under general\\nanesthesia. Computerized mapping techniques are\\ncombined with a cold probe to destroy arrhythmia-\\ncausing tissue. Ablation is generally successful. When\\nablation is used for atrial fibrillation, it is usually\\nfollowed by implantation of a pacemaker as well as\\ndrug therapy.\\nKEY TERMS\\nArrhythmia— A variation in the normal rhythm of\\nthe heart beat.

Lead wires\\nthreaded to the right side ofthe heart supply electrical\\nenergy to pace the atria and ventricles. The implantable\\ncardioverter defibrillator is a treatment for serious\\narrhythmias. The battery-powered device senses an\\nabnormal heart rhythm and automatically provides elec-\\ntrical shock(s). The shock(s)suspends heart activity and\\nthen allows the heart to initiate a normal rhythm. Wire\\nelectrodes on the device are attached to the heart. Some\\nof the electrodes are attached to the outside of the heart\\nand some are attached to the inside of the heart through\\nveins. The newest implantablecardioverter defibrillators\\ncan be implanted in the chest wall and do not require\\nopen chest surgery. These devices weigh less than 10 oz\\nand generally last seven or eight years. An implantable\\ncardioverter defibrillator is usually used with drug ther-\\napy, but the amount medication is reduced. In maze\\nsurgery, often the last resort, surgeons create a maze of\\nstitches (sutures) that help theheart’s electrical impulses\\ntravel effectively.\\nMost of the drugs used for treatment have poten-\\ntial side effects and should be carefully monitored by a\\ndoctor. The goal of treatment is to control the rate and\\nrhythm of the heart and to prevent the formation of\\nblood clots. If the arrhythmia is caused by heart dis-\\nease, the heart disease will also be treated. The\\nAmerican Heart Association recommends aggressive\\ntreatment.\\nA digitalis drug, most commonly digoxin, is\\nusually prescribed to control the heart rate. Digitalis\\ndrugs slow the heart’s electrical impulses, helping to\\nrestore the normal rate and rhythm. These drugs also\\nincrease the ability of the heart’s muscular layer to\\ncontract and pump properly. Beta-blockers and\\ncalcium channel blockers can also be used for this\\npurpose. Beta-blockers slow the speed of electrical\\nimpulses through the heart. Some calcium channel\\nblockers dampen the heart’s response to erratic elec-\\ntrical impulses.\\nTo prevent blood clots, aspirin or warfarin\\n(Coumadin) is administered.

This abnormal\\nopening is called an atrial septal defect and causes\\nblood from the left atrium to flow into the right\\natrium.\\nDifferent types of atrial septal defects can\\noccur, and they are classified according to where\\nin the separating wall they are found. The most\\ncommonly found atrial septal defect occurs in the\\nmiddle of the atrial septum and accounts for about\\n70% of all atrial septal defects. Abnormal openings\\ncan form in the upper and lower parts of the atrial\\nseptum as well.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAbnormal openings in the atrial septum occur\\nduring fetal development and are twice as common\\nin females as in males. These abnormalities can go\\nunnoticed if the opening is small, producing no\\nabnormal symptoms. If the defect is big, large\\namounts of blood flowing from the left to the\\nright atrium will cause the right atrium to swell to\\nhold the extra blood.\\nPeople born with an atrial septal defect can have\\nno symptoms through their twenties, but by age 40,\\nmost people with this condition have symptoms that\\ncan includeshortness of breath, rapid abnormal beat-\\ning of the atria (atrial fibrillation), and eventually\\nheart failure.\\nDiagnosis\\nAtrial septal defects can be identified by various\\nmethods. Abnormal changes in the sound of the\\nheart beats can be heard when a doctor listens to\\nthe heart with a stethoscope. In addition, achest\\nxr a y, an electrocardiogram (ECG, an electrical\\nprintout of the heartbeats), and an echocardiogram\\n(a test that uses sound waves to form a detailed\\nimage of the heart) can also be used to identify\\nthis condition.\\nAn atrial septal defect can also be diagnosed by\\nusing a test calledcardiac catheterization.T h i st e s t\\ninvolves inserting a very thin tube (catheter) into the\\nheart’s chambers to measure the amount of oxygen\\npresent in the blood within the heart. If the heart\\nhas an opening between the atria, oxygen-rich blood\\nfrom the left atrium enters the right atrium.\\nThrough cardiac catheterization, doctors can detect\\nthe higher-than-normal amount of oxygen in the\\nheart’s right atrium, rightventricle, and the large\\nblood vessels that carry blood to the lungs, where\\nthe blood would normally subsequently get its\\noxygen.\\nTreatment\\nAtrial septal defects often correct themselves with-\\nout medical treatments by the age of two. If this dose\\nnot happen, surgery is done by sewing the hole closed,\\nor by sewing a patch of Dacron material or a piece of\\nthe sac that surrounds the heart (the pericardium),\\nover the opening.\\nSome patients can have the defect fixed by having\\nan clam-shaped plug placed over the opening. This\\nplug is a man-made device that is put in place through\\na catheter inserted into the heart.\\nPrognosis\\nIndividuals with small defects can live a normal\\nlife, but larger defects require surgical correction. Less\\nthan 1% of people younger than 45 years of age die\\nfrom corrective surgery. Five to ten percent of patients\\ncan die from the surgery if they are older than 40 and\\nhave other heart-related problems.

Although difficult to assess in infancy and\\ntoddlerhood, signs of ADHD may begin to appear as\\nearly as age two or three, but the symptom picture\\nchanges as adolescence approaches. Many symptoms,\\nparticularly hyperactivity, diminish in early adult-\\nhood, but impulsivity and inattention problems\\nremain with up to 50% of ADHD individuals\\nthroughout their adult life.\\nChildren with ADHD have short attention\\nspans, becoming easily bored and/or frustrated\\nwith tasks. Although they may be quite intelligent,\\ntheir lack of focus frequently results in poor grades\\nand difficulties in school. ADHD children act\\nimpulsively, taking action first and thinking later.\\nThey are constantly moving, running, climbing,\\nsquirming, and fidgeting, but often have trouble\\nwith gross and fine motor skills and, as a result,\\nmay be physically clumsy and awkward. Their\\nclumsiness may extend to the social arena, where\\nthey are sometimes shunned due to their impulsive\\nand intrusive behavior.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of ADHD are not known. However,\\nit appears that heredity plays a major role in the\\ndevelopment of ADHD. Children with an ADHD\\nparent or sibling are more likely to develop the\\ndisorder themselves. In 2004, scientists reported at\\nleast 20 candidate genes that might contribute to\\nADHD, but no single gene stood out as the gene\\ncausing the condition. Before birth, ADHD children\\nmay have been exposed to poor maternalnutrition,\\nviral infections, or maternal substance abuse .I n\\nearly childhood, exposure to lead or other toxins\\ncan cause ADHD-like symptoms. Traumatic brain\\ninjury or neurological disorders may also trigger\\nADHD symptoms. Although the exact cause of\\nADHD is not known, an imbalance of certain neu-\\nrotransmitters, the chemicals in the brain that trans-\\nmit messages between nerve cells, is believed to be\\nthe mechanism behind ADHD symptoms.\\nA widely publicized study conducted by Dr. Ben\\nFeingold in the early 1970s suggested that allergies to\\ncertain foods and food additives caused the character-\\nistic hyperactivity of ADHD children. Although some\\nchildren may have adverse reactions to certain foods\\nthat can affect their behavior (for example, a rash\\nmight temporarily cause a child to be distracted from\\nother tasks), carefully controlled follow-up studies\\nhave uncovered no link betweenfood allergies and\\nADHD. Another popularly held misconception\\nabout food and ADHD is that the consumption of\\nsugar causes hyperactive behavior. Again, studies\\nhave shown no link between sugar intake and\\nADHD. It is important to note, however, that a nutri-\\ntionally balanced diet is important for normal devel-\\nopment inall children.\\nPsychologists and other mental health profes-\\nsionals typically use the criteria listed in theDiagnostic\\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth\\nDrugs Used To Treat ADHD\\nBrand Name (Generic Name) Possible Common Side Effects\\nInclude:\\nCylert (pemoline) Insomnia\\nDexedrine (dextroamphetamine\\nsulfate)\\nExcessive stimulation, restlessness\\nRitalin (methylphenidate\\nhydrochloride)\\nInsomnia, nervousness, loss of\\nappetite\\nKEY TERMS\\nConduct disorder— A behavioral and emotional\\ndisorder of childhood and adolescence.

The pediatrician can\\nmake an initial evaluation of the child’s developmental\\nmaturity compared to other children in his or her age\\ngroup. The physician should also perform a compre-\\nhensivephysical examination to rule out any organic\\ncauses of ADHD symptoms, such as an overactive\\nthyroid or vision or hearing problems.\\nIf no organic problem can be found, a psycholo-\\ngist, psychiatrist, neurologist, neuropsychologist, or\\nlearning specialist is typically consulted to perform a\\ncomprehensive ADHD assessment. A complete medi-\\ncal, family, social, psychiatric, and educational history\\nis compiled from existing medical and school records\\nand from interviews with parents and teachers.\\nInterviews may also be conducted with the child,\\ndepending on his or her age. Along with these inter-\\nviews, several clinical inventories may also be used,\\nsuch as the Conners Rating Scales (Teacher’s\\nQuestionnaire and Parent’s Questionnaire), Child\\nBehavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Achenbach\\nChild Behavior Rating Scales. These inventories pro-\\nvide valuable information on the child’s behavior in\\ndifferent settings and situations. In addition, the\\nWender Utah Rating Scale has been adapted for use\\nin diagnosing ADHD in adults.\\nIt is important to note that mental disorders such\\nas depression andanxiety disorder can cause symp-\\ntoms similar to ADHD. A complete and comprehen-\\nsive psychiatric assessment is critical to differentiate\\nADHD from other possible mood and behavioral dis-\\norders.Bipolar disorder, for example, may be misdiag-\\nnosed as ADHD.\\nPublic schools are required by federal law to offer\\nfree ADHD testing upon request. A pediatrician can\\nalso provide a referral to a psychologist or pediatric\\nspecialist for ADHD assessment. Parents should\\ncheck with their insurance plans to see if these services\\nare covered.\\nTreatment\\nPsychosocial therapy, usually combined with\\nmedications, is the treatment approach of choice to\\nalleviate ADHD symptoms. Psychostimulants, such\\nas dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), pemoline\\n(Cylert), and methylphenidate (Ritalin) are commonly\\nprescribed to control hyperactive and impulsive beha-\\nvior and increase attention span. They work by stimu-\\nlating the production of certain neurotransmitters in\\nthe brain. Possible side effects of stimulants include\\nnervous tics, irregular heartbeat, loss of appetite, and\\ninsomnia. However, the medications are usually well-\\ntolerated and safe in most cases. In 2004, longer-acting\\nstimulants had been released to treat adult ADHD.\\nIn 2004, the American Academy of Child and\\nAdolescent Psychiatry listed the first nonstimulant as a\\nfirst-line therapy for ADHD. Called atomoxetine HCI\\n(Strattera), it is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.\\nIn children who do not respond well to stimulant\\ntherapy, tricyclic antidepressantssuch as desipramine\\n(Norpramin, Pertofane) and amitriptyline (Elavil) are\\nsometimes recommended. Reported side effects of\\nthese drugs include persistent dry mouth, sedation,\\ndisorientation, and cardiac arrhythmia (particularly\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 457\\nAttention-deficit/Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 487, 'page_label': '488'}, page_content='with desipramine). Other medications prescribed for\\nADHD therapy include buproprion (Wellbutrin), an\\nantidepressant; fluoxetine (Prozac), anSSRI antide-\\npressant; and carbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol), an\\nanticonvulsant drug. Clonidine (Catapres), an antihy-\\npertensive medication, has also been used to control\\naggression and hyperactivity in some ADHD children,\\nalthough it should not be used with Ritalin. A child’s\\nresponse to medication will change with age and\\nmaturation, so ADHD symptoms should be moni-\\ntored closely and prescriptions adjusted accordingly.\\nBehavior modification therapy uses a reward sys-\\ntem to reinforce good behavior and task completion\\nand can be implemented both in the classroom and at\\nhome. A tangible reward such as a sticker may be\\ngiven to the child every time he completes a task or\\nbehaves in an acceptable manner. A chart system may\\nbe used to display the stickers and visually illustrate\\nthe child’s progress. When a certain number of stickers\\nare collected, the child may trade them in for a bigger\\nreward such as a trip to the zoo or a day at the beach.\\nThe reward system stays in place until the good beha-\\nvior becomes ingrained.\\nA variation of this technique,cognitive-behavioral\\ntherapy, works to decrease impulsive behavior by get-\\nting the child to recognize the connection between\\nthoughts and behavior, and to change behavior by\\nchanging negative thinking patterns.\\nIndividual psychotherapy can help an ADHD\\nchild build self-esteem, give them a place to discuss\\ntheir worries and anxieties, and help them gain insight\\ninto their behavior and feelings. Family therapy may\\nalso be beneficial in helping family members develop\\ncoping skills and in working through feelings of guilt\\nor anger parents may be experiencing.\\nADHD children perform better within a familiar,\\nconsistent, and structured routine with positive rein-\\nforcements for good behavior and real consequences\\nfor bad. Family, friends, and caretakers should all be\\neducated on the special needs and behaviors of the\\nADHD child. Communication between parents and\\nteachers is especially critical to ensuring an ADHD\\nchild has an appropriate learning environment.\\nAlternative treatment\\nA number of alternative treatments exist for\\nADHD. Although there is a lack of controlled studies\\nto prove their efficacy, proponents report that they are\\nsuccessful in controlling symptoms in some ADHD\\npatients. Some of the more popular alternative treat-\\nments include:\\n/C15EEG (electroencephalograph)biofeedback. By mea-\\nsuring brainwave activity and teaching the ADHD\\npatient which type of brainwave is associated with\\nattention, EEG biofeedback attempts to train\\npatients to generate the desired brainwave activity.\\n/C15Dietary therapy. Based in part on the Feingold food\\nallergy diet, dietary therapy focuses on a nutritional\\nplan that is high in protein and complex carbohy-\\ndrates and free of white sugar and salicylate-contain-\\ning foods such as strawberries, tomatoes, and grapes.\\n/C15Herbal therapy. Herbal therapy uses a variety of\\nnatural remedies to address the symptoms of\\nADHD, such as ginkgo (Gingko biloba) for memory\\nand mental sharpness and chamomile (Matricaria\\nrecutita) extract for calming. The safety of herbal\\nremedies has not been demonstrated in controlled\\nstudies. For example, it is known that gingko may\\naffect blood coagulation, but controlled studies have\\nnot yet evaluated the risk of the effect.\\n/C15Homeopathic medicine. The theory of homeopathic\\nmedicine is to treat the whole person at a core level.\\nConstitutional homeopathic care requires consulting\\nwith a well-trained homeopath who has experience\\nworking with ADD and ADHD individuals.\\nPrognosis\\nUntreated, ADHD negatively affects a child’s\\nsocial and educational performance and can seriously\\ndamage his or her sense of self-esteem. ADHD child-\\nren have impaired relationships with their peers, and\\nmay be looked upon as social outcasts. They may be\\nperceived as slow learners or troublemakers in the\\nclassroom. Siblings and even parents may develop\\nresentful feelings towards the ADHD child.\\nSome ADHD children also develop a conduct\\ndisorder problem.

The test is performed\\nwith the use of electronic equipment called an audio-\\nmeter. This testing is usually administered by a trained\\ntechnician called an audiologist.\\nPurpose\\nAudiometry testing is used to identify and diag-\\nnose hearing loss. The equipment is used in health\\nscreening programs, for example in grade schools, to\\ndetect hearing problems in children. It is also used in\\nthe doctor’s office or hospital audiology department\\nto diagnose hearing problems in children, adults, and\\nthe elderly. With correct diagnosis of a person’s spe-\\ncific pattern of hearing impairment, the right type of\\ntherapy, which might includehearing aids, corrective\\nsurgery, or speech therapy, can be prescribed.\\nPrecautions\\nTesting with audiometry equipment is simple and\\npainless. No special precautions are required.\\nDescription\\nA trained audiologist (a specialist in detecting\\nhearing loss) uses an audiometer to conduct audiome-\\ntry testing. This equipment emits sounds or tones, like\\nmusical notes, at various frequencies, or pitches, and\\nat differing volumes or levels of loudness. Testing is\\nusually done in a soundproof testing room.\\nThe person being tested wears a set of head-\\nphones that blocks out other distracting sounds and\\ndelivers a test tone to one ear at a time. At the sound\\nof a tone, the patient holds up a hand or finger to\\nindicate that the sound is detected. The audiologist\\nlowers the volume and repeats the sound until the\\npatient can no longer detect it. This process is\\nrepeated over a wide range of tones or frequencies\\nfrom very deep, low sounds, like the lowest note\\nplayed on a tuba, to very high sounds, like the\\npinging of a triangle. Each ear is tested separately.\\nIt is not unusual for levels of sensitivity to sound to\\ndiffer from one ear to the other.\\nA second type of audiometry testing uses a head-\\nband rather than headphones.

The\\npatient being tested senses the tones that are trans-\\nmitted as vibrations through the bones to the inner\\near. As with the headphones, the tones are repeated at\\nvarious frequencies and volumes.\\nThe results of the audiometry test may be recorded\\non a grid or graph called an audiogram. This graph is\\ngenerally set up with low frequencies or tones at one end\\nand high ones at the other end, much like a piano key-\\nboard. Low notes are graphed on the left and high notes\\non the right. The graph also charts the volume of the\\ntones used; from soft, quiet sounds at the top of the\\nchart to loud sounds at the bottom. Hearing is mea-\\nsured in units called decibels. Most of the sounds asso-\\nciated with normal speech patterns are generally spoken\\nin the range of 20-50 decibels. An adult with normal\\nhearing can detect tones between 0-20 decibels.\\nSpeech audiometry is another type of testing that\\nuses a series of simple recorded words spoken at var-\\nious volumes into headphones worn by the patient\\nbeing tested. The patient repeats each word back to\\nthe audiologist as it is heard. An adult with normal\\nhearing will be able to recognize and repeat 90-100%\\nof the words.\\nPreparation\\nThe ears may be examined with an otoscope prior\\nto audiometry testing to determine if there are any\\nblockages in the ear canal due to ear wax or other\\nmaterial.\\nNormal results\\nA person with normal hearing will be able to\\nrecognize and respond to all of the tone frequencies\\nadministered at various volumes in both ears by the\\naudiometry test. An adult with normal hearing can\\ndetect a range of low and high pitched sounds that\\nare played as softly as between nearly 0-20 decibels.\\nNormal speech is generally spoken in the range of\\n20-50 decibels.\\nAbnormal results\\nAudiometry test results are considered abnormal\\nif there is a significant or unexplained difference\\nbetween the levels of sound heard between the two\\nears, or if the person being tested is unable to hear in\\nthe normal range of frequencies and volume.

Reproduced by\\npermission.)\\nInternationally renowned French otolaryngologist,\\npsychologist, educator and inventor Alfred Tomatis per-\\nceived the importance of sound and hearing early in\\nhis career. He took his degree as a Doctor of Medicine\\nfrom the University of Paris and specialized in ear,\\nnose and throat medicine. The son of two opera sing-\\ners, Tomatis early in his career treated some of his\\nparents’ fellow opera singers. From these experiences with\\nthe sound of music, he developed the principle that has\\ncome to be known as the Tomatis Effect, i.e. that the human\\nvoice can only sing what it hears.\\nTomatis has been called the Einstein of the ear. It was\\nhis research that made the world aware that the ears of an\\ninfant in utero are already functioning at four and half\\nmonths of age. Just as the umbilical cord provides nourish-\\nment to the unborn infant’s body, Tomatis postulated that\\nthe sound of the mother’s voice is also a nutrient heard by\\nthe fetus. This sound literally charges and stimulates the\\ngrowth of the brain.\\nTomatis took this further, into the realm of language.\\nTomatis concluded that the need to communicate and to\\nbe understood are among our most basic needs. He was a\\npioneer in perceiving that language problems convert into\\nsocial problems for people. ‘‘Language is what charac-\\nterizes man and makes him different from other creatures,’’\\nTomatis is quoted as saying. The techniques he developed\\nto teach people how to listen effectively are internationally\\nrespected tools used in the treatment of autism, attention-\\ndeficit disorder, and other learning disabilities.\\nHis listening program, the invention of the Electronic\\nEar, and his work with the therapeutic use of sound and\\nmusic for the past fifty years have made Tomatis arguably\\nthe best known and most successful ear specialist in the\\nworld. There are more than two hundred Tomatis Centers\\nworldwide, treating a vast variety of problems related to\\nthe ability to hear.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 461\\nAuditory integration training'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 491, 'page_label': '492'}, page_content='/C15The capacity to listen can be changed or improved\\nthrough auditory stimulation using musical and\\nvocal sounds at high frequencies.\\n/C15Communication begins in the womb.

This can cause profound problems in perso-\\nnal behavior and in the ability to relate to others. A\\nperson with autism must learn how to communicate\\nnormally and how to relate to people, objects and\\nevents. However, not all patients suffer the same\\ndegree of impairment. There is a full spectrum of\\nsymptoms, which can range from mild to severe.\\nAutism occurs in as many as one or two per 1,000\\nchildren. It is found four times more often in boys\\n(usually the first-born) and occurs around the world\\nin all races and social backgrounds. Autism usually is\\nevident in the first three years of life, although in some\\nchildren it’s hard to tell when the problem develops.\\nSometimes the condition isn’t diagnosed until the\\nchild enters school.\\nWhile a person with autism can have symptoms\\nranging from mild to severe, about 10% have an\\nextraordinary ability in one area, such as in mathe-\\nmatics, memory, music, or art. Such children are\\nknown as ‘‘autistic savants’’ (formerly known as\\n‘‘idiot savants.’’).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAutism is a brain disorder that affects the way the\\nbrain uses or transmits information. Studies have\\nfound abnormalities in several parts of the brain that\\nalmost certainly occurred during fetal development.\\nThe problem may be centered in the parts of the\\nbrain responsible for processing language and infor-\\nmation from the senses.\\nThere appears to be a strong genetic basis for\\nautism. Identical twins are more likely to both be\\naffected than twins who are fraternal (not genetically\\nidentical). In a family with one autistic child, the\\nchance of having another child with autism is about\\n1 in 20, much higher than in the normal population.\\nSometimes, relatives of an autistic child have mild\\nbehaviors that look very much like autism, such as\\nrepetitive behaviors and social or communication\\nproblems. Research also has found that some emo-\\ntional disorders (such as manic depression) occur\\nmore often in families of a child with autism.\\nAt least one group of researchers has found a link\\nbetween an abnormal gene and autism. The gene may\\nbe just one of at least three to five genes that interact in\\nsome way to cause the condition. Scientists suspect\\nthat a faulty gene or genes might make a person vul-\\nnerable to develop autism in the presence of other\\nfactors, such as a chemical imbalance, viruses or che-\\nmicals, or a lack of oxygen at birth.\\nIn a few cases, autistic behavior is caused by a\\ndisease such as:\\n/C15rubella in the pregnant mother\\n/C15tuberous sclerosis\\n/C15fragile X syndrome\\n/C15encephalitis\\n/C15untreated phenylketonuria\\nThe severity of the condition varies between indi-\\nviduals, ranging from the most severe (extremely unu-\\nsual, repetitive, self- injurious, and aggressive\\nbehavior) to very mild, resembling a personality dis-\\norder with some learning disability.\\nProfound problems with social interaction are the\\nmost common symptoms of autism. Infants with the\\ndisorder won’t cuddle; they avoid eye contact and\\ndon’t seem to want or need physical contact or affec-\\ntion. They may become rigid or flaccid when they are\\nheld, cry when picked up, and show little interest in\\nhuman contact. Such a child doesn’t smile or lift his\\narms in anticipation of being picked up. He forms no\\nattachment to parents nor shows any normal anxiety\\ntoward strangers. He doesn’t learn typical games of\\nchildhood, such as peek-a-boo.\\nLanguage problems\\nThe child with autism may not speak at all; if he\\ndoes, it is often in single words. He may endlessly\\nrepeat words or phrases that are addressed to him\\nand may reverse pronouns (‘‘You go sleep’’ instead\\nof ‘‘I want to go to sleep’’).\\nRestricted interests and activity\\nUsually a child with autism has many problems\\nplaying normally. He probably won’t act out adultroles\\nduring play time, and instead of enjoying fantasy play,\\nhe may simply repeatedly mimic the actions of someone\\nelse. Bizarre behavior patterns are very common among\\nautistic children and may include complex rituals,\\nscreaming fits, rhythmic rocking, arm flapping, finger\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 463\\nAutism'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 493, 'page_label': '494'}, page_content='twiddling, and crying without tears.

Many of these\\nchildren may react to sounds by banging their head\\nor flapping fingers.

It\\ncauses progressive muscle weakness andparalysis.\\n/C15Multiple sclerosis. An autoimmune disorder that may\\ninvolve a virus affects the central nervous system,\\ncausing loss of coordination and muscle control.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nTo further understand autoimmune disorders, it is\\nhelpful to understand the workings of the immune\\nsystem. The purpose of the immune system is to defend\\nthe body against attack by infectious microbes (germs)\\nand foreign objects. When the immune system attacks\\nan invader, it is very specific—a particular immune\\nsystem cell will only recognize and target one type of\\ninvader. To function properly, the immune system must\\nnot only develop this specialized knowledge of indivi-\\ndual invaders, but it must also learn how to recognize\\nand not destroy cells that belong to the body itself.\\nEvery cell carries protein markers on its surface that\\nidentifies it in one of two ways: what kind of cell it is\\n(e.g. nerve cell, muscle cell, blood cell, etc.) and to\\nwhom that cell belongs. These markers are called\\nmajor histocompatability complexes (MHCs). When\\nfunctioning properly, cells of the immune system will\\nnot attack any other cell with markers identifying it as\\nbelonging to the body. Conversely, if the immune sys-\\ntem cells do not recognize the cell as ‘‘self,’’ they attach\\nthemselves to it and put out a signal that the body has\\nbeen invaded, which in turn stimulates the production\\nof substances such as antibodies that engulf and destroy\\nthe foreign particles. In case of autoimmune disorders,\\nthe immune system cannot distinguish between ‘‘self’’\\ncells and invader cells. As a result, the same destructive\\noperation is carried out on the body’s own cells that\\nwould normally be carried out on bacteria, viruses, and\\nother such harmful entities.\\nThe reasons why immune systems become dys-\\nfunctional in this way is not well understood.\\nHowever, most researchers agree that a combination\\nof genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors\\nplay into autoimmunity. Researchers also speculate\\nthat certain mechanisms may trigger autoimmunity.\\nFirst, a substance that is normally restricted to one\\npart of the body, and therefore not usually exposed\\nto the immune system, is released into other areas\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 467\\nAutoimmune disorders'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 497, 'page_label': '498'}, page_content='where it is attacked. Second, the immune system\\nmay mistake a component of the body for a similar\\nforeign component. Third, cells of the body may be\\naltered in some way, either by drugs, infection, or\\nsome other environmental factor, so that they are\\nno longer recognizable as ‘‘self’’ to the immune\\nsystem. Fourth, the immune system itself may be\\ndamaged, such as by a genetic mutation, and there-\\nfore cannot function properly.\\nThe symptoms of the above disorders include:\\n/C15Systemic lupus erythematosus. Symptoms include\\nfever, chills,fatigue, weight loss, skinrashes (particu-\\nlarly the classic ‘‘butterfly’’ rash on the face), vasculi-\\ntis, polyarthralgia, patchy hair loss, sores in the mouth\\nor nose, lymph-node enlargement, gastric problems,\\nand, in women, irregular periods. About half of those\\nwho suffer from lupus develop cardiopulmonary pro-\\nblems, and some may also develop urinary problems.\\nLupus can also effect the central nervous system,\\ncausing seizures, depression, and psychosis.\\n/C15Rheumatoid arthritis. Initially may be characterized\\nby a low-gradefever, loss of appetite, weight loss,\\nand a generalizedpain in the joints. The joint pain\\nthen becomes more specific, usually beginning in the\\nfingers, then spreading to other areas, such as the\\nwrists, elbows, knees, and ankles. As the disease\\nprogresses, joint function diminishes sharply and\\ndeformities occur, particularly the characteristic\\n‘‘swan’s neck’’ curling of the fingers.\\n/C15Goodpasture’s syndrome. Symptoms are similar to\\nthat of iron deficiency anemia, including fatigue and\\npallor. Symptoms involving the lungs may range\\nfrom a cough that produces bloody sputum to out-\\nright hemorrhaging. Symptoms involving the urin-\\nary system include blood in the urine and/or swelling.\\n/C15Grave’s disease. This disease is characterized by an\\nenlarged thyroid gland, weight loss without loss of\\nappetite, sweating, heartpalpitations, nervousness,\\nand an inability to tolerate heat.\\n/C15Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. This disorder generally dis-\\nplays no symptoms.\\n/C15Pemphigus vulgaris. This disease is characterized by\\nblisters and deep lesions on the skin.\\n/C15Myasthenia gravis. Characterized by fatigue and mus-\\ncle weakness that at first may be confined to certain\\nmuscle groups, but then may progress to the point of\\nparalysis. Myasthenia gravis patients often have\\nexpressionless faces as well as difficulty chewing and\\nswallowing. If the disease progresses to the respiratory\\nsystem, artificial respiration may be required.\\n/C15Scleroderma. Disorder is usually preceded by\\nRaynaud’s phenomenon. Symptoms that follow\\ninclude pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints,\\nand the skin takes on a tight, shiny appearance. The\\ndigestive system also becomes involved, resulting in\\nweight loss, appetite loss, diarrhea,constipation, and\\ndistention of the abdomen. As the disease progresses,\\nthe heart, lungs, and kidneys become involved, and\\nmalignanthypertension causes death in approxi-\\nmately 30% of cases.\\n/C15Autoimmune hemolytic anemia. May be acute or\\nchronic. Symptoms include fatigue and abdominal\\ntenderness due to an enlarged spleen.\\n/C15Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Character-\\nized by pinhead-size red dots on the skin, unexplained\\nbruises, bleeding from the nose and gums, and blood in\\nthe stool.\\n/C15Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis. In polymyositis,\\nsymptoms include muscle weakness, particularly in\\nthe shoulders or pelvis, that prevents the patient from\\nperforming everyday activities. In dermatomyositis,\\nthe same muscle weakness is accompanied by a rash\\nthat appears on the upper body, arms, and fingertips.\\nA rash may also appear on the eyelids, and the area\\naround the eyes may become swollen.\\n/C15Pernicious anemia. Signs of pernicious anemia\\ninclude weakness, sore tongue, bleeding gums, and\\ntinglingin the extremities. Because the disease causes\\na decrease in stomach acid, nausea,vomiting, loss of\\nappetite, weight loss,diarrhea, and constipation are\\npossible. Also, because Vitamin B12 is essential for\\nthe nervous system function, the deficiency of it\\nbrought on by the disease can result in a host of\\nneurological problems, including weakness, lack of\\ncoordination, blurred vision, loss of fine motor skills,\\nloss of the sense of taste, ringing in the ears, and loss\\nof bladder control.\\n/C15Sjo¨ gren’s syndrome.

There may be dizziness, depression,\\nloss of bladder control, and muscle weakness so\\nsevere that the patient is confined to a wheelchair.\\nDiagnosis\\nA number of tests are involved in the diagnosis\\nof autoimmune diseases, depending on the particular\\ndisease; e.g. blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid analysis,\\nelectromylogram (measur es muscle function), and\\nmagnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Usually,\\nthese tests determine the location and extent of\\ndamage or involvement. They are useful in charting\\nprogress of the disease and as baselines for\\ntreatment.\\nThe principle tool, however, for authenticating\\nautoimmune disease is antibody testing. Such tests\\ninvolve measuring the level of antibodies found in\\nthe blood and determining if they react with specific\\nantigens that would give rise to an autoimmune reac-\\ntion. An elevated amount of antibodies indicates that\\na humoral immune reaction is occurring. Since ele-\\nvated antibody levels are also seen in common infec-\\ntions, they must be ruled out as the cause for the\\nincreased antibody levels.\\nAntibodies can also be typed by class. There are\\nfive classes of antibodies, and they can be separated in\\nthe laboratory. The class IgG is usually associated\\nwith autoimmune diseases. Unfortunately, IgG class\\nantibodies are also the main class of antibody seen in\\nnormal immune responses.\\nThe most useful antibody tests involve introdu-\\ncing the patient’s antibodies to samples of his or her\\nown tissue, usually thyroid, stomach, liver, and kidney\\ntissue. If antibodies bind to the ‘‘self’’ tissue, it is\\ndiagnostic for an autoimmune disorder. Antibodies\\nfrom a person without an autoimmune disorder\\nwould not react to ‘‘self ’’ tissue.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of autoimmune diseases is specific to\\nthe disease, and usually concentrates on alleviating or\\npreventing symptoms rather than correcting the\\nunderlying cause. For example, if a gland involved in\\nan autoimmune reaction is not producing a hormone\\nsuch as insulin, administration of that hormone is\\nrequired. Administration of a hormone, however,\\nwill restore the function of the gland damaged by the\\nautoimmune disease.\\nThe other aspect of treatment is controlling the\\ninflammatory and proliferative nature of the immune\\nresponse. This is generally accomplished with two\\ntypes of drugs. Steroid compounds are used to control\\ninflammation. There are many different steroids, each\\nhaving side effects. The proliferative nature of the\\nimmune response is controlled with immunosuppres-\\nsive drugs. These drugs work by inhibiting the replica-\\ntion of cells and, therefore, also suppress non-immune\\ncells leading to side effects such as anemia.\\nSystemic enzyme therapyis a new treatment that is\\nshowing results for rheumatoid arthritis, multiple\\nsclerosis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other inflamma-\\ntory diseases. Enzymes combinations of pancreatin,\\ntrypsin, chymotrypsin, bromelain, and papain help\\nstimulate the body’s own defenses, accelerate inflam-\\nmation in order to reduce swelling and improve circu-\\nlation, and break up the immune complexes within the\\nbloodstream. Symptoms have been reduced using this\\ntreatment.\\nOther treatments that hold some promise are irra-\\ndiation of the spleen andgene therapy. Splenic irradia-\\ntion is touted to be a safe, alternative for patients with\\nautoimmune blood diseases, especially autoimmune\\nhemolytic anemia, or others with compromised\\nimmune systems, such as HIV patients and the elderly.\\nIt is reported to have few side effects and seems to be\\nworking. Cytokine and cytokine inhibitor genes\\ninjected directly into muscle tissue also appear to be\\neffective in treating Type I diabetes mellitus, systemic\\nlupus erythematosus, thyroditis, and arthritis.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis depends upon the pathology of each\\nautoimmune disease.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 469\\nAutoimmune disorders'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 499, 'page_label': '500'}, page_content='Prevention\\nMost autoimmune diseases cannot be prevented.\\nThough the mechanisms involved in how these dis-\\neases affect the body are known, it is still unclear\\nwhy the body turns on itself.

During the autopsy, very concise notes\\nand documentation must be made for both medical\\nand legal reasons. Some religious groups prohibit\\nautopsies.\\nDescription\\nAn autopsy can be described as the examination\\nof a deceased human body with a detailed exam of\\nthe person’s remains. This procedure dates back to\\nthe Roman era when few human dissections were\\nperformed; autopsies were utilized, however, to\\ndetermine the cause of death in criminal cases. At\\nthe beginning of the procedure the exterior body is\\nexamined and then the internal organs are removed\\nand studied. Some pathologists argue that more\\nautopsies are performed than necessary. However,\\nrecent studies show that autopsies can detect major\\nfindings about a person’s condition that were not\\nsuspected when the person was alive. And the grow-\\ning awareness of the influence of genetic factors in\\ndisease has also emphasized the importance of\\nautopsies.\\nDespite the usefulness of autopsies, fewer autop-\\nsies have been performed in the United States during\\nthe past 10-20 years. A possible reason for this decline\\nis concern about malpractice suits on the part of the\\ntreating physician. Other possible reasons are that\\nhospitals are performing fewer autopsies because of\\nthe expense or because modern technology, such as\\nCT scans and magnetic resonance imaging, can\\noften provide sufficient diagnostic information.\\nNonetheless, federal regulators and pathology groups\\nhave begun to establish new guidelines designed to\\nincrease the number and quality of autopsies being\\nperformed.\\nMany experts are concerned that if the number of\\nautopsies increases, hospitals may be forced to charge\\nfamilies a fee for the procedure as autopies are not\\nnormally covered by insurance companies or\\nMedicare. Yet, according to several pathologists, the\\nbenefit of the procedure for families and doctors does\\njustify the cost. In medical autopsies, physicians\\nremain cautious to examine only as much of the\\nbody as permitted according to the wishes of the\\nfamily. It is important to note that autopsies can also\\nprovide peace of mind for the bereaved family in cer-\\ntain situations.\\nPreparation\\nIf a medical autopsy is being performed, written\\npermission is secured from the family of the deceased\\nAftercare\\nOnce the autopsy has been completed, the body is\\nprepared for final arrangements according to the\\nfamily’s wishes\\nRisks\\nThere are some risks of disease transmission from\\nthe deceased.

These symptoms\\ncould cause the pilot to lose control of the plane.\\nHypoxia can be treated withoxygen therapy.\\nRapid altitude increases and decreases can cause\\npain because there is an air pocket in the middle por-\\ntion of the ear. To equalize pressure in the ear, physi-\\ncians typically advise pilots and passengers to clear\\ntheir sinuses by plugging their nose and blowing until\\nthe eardrums ‘‘pop.’’ Other options include yawning,\\nswallowing or chewing gum. For people with a cold or\\na severely blocked middle ear, the use ofdecongestants,\\nantihistamines, or nasal sprays may help. Without tak-\\ning steps to equalize pressure, the tympanic membrane\\ncould rupture, causing hearing loss, vertigo, dizziness,\\nandnausea.\\nGravity’s impact\\nFighter pilots who fly high-performance jets can\\nexperience health problems during rapid acceleration\\nand when executing tight turns at high speed. During\\nthese moves, a pilot experiences extreme gravity con-\\nditions that can pull blood away from the brain and\\nheart and into the lower body. This can cause the pilot\\nto have tunnel vision or pass out. To prevent these\\npotentially deadly situations, the military requires\\nfighter pilots to wear special flight suits, or G suits,\\nwhich have compartments that fill with air or fluid to\\nkeep blood from pooling in the lower body.\\nSome pilots, like the Blue Angels, use a technique\\ncalled the Valsalva Maneuver instead of G suits to\\nprevent black outs during high-performance flying.\\nThe Valsalva Maneuver involves grunting and tigh-\\ntening the abdominal muscles to stop blood from\\ncollecting in the wrong parts of the body.\\nPREVENTIVE CARE. Since any routine health pro-\\nblem that affects a pilot could mean the loss of\\nhundreds of lives, aviation medicine specialists who\\nwork for commercial airlines and the military take\\nspecial care to educate pilots about proper diet,\\nexercise and preventive health tools. For example,\\nphysicians may frequently screen pilots for vision\\nchanges caused byglaucoma or cataracts. They\\nalso will check for hearing loss and encourage the\\npilot to wear earplugs or headphones to buffer\\nengine noise. To monitor for heart disease, physi-\\ncians will check blood pressure and may order diag-\\nnostic tests such as an ECG orstress test.\\nMotion sickness\\nMany people experience nausea, vertigo, and dis-\\norientation when they first arrive in space. This is\\ncaused by changes in the fluid in the inner ear, which\\nis sensitive to gravity and affects our sense of spatial\\norientation. The symptoms typically ease after several\\ndays, but often recur when the astronaut returns to\\nEarth. To treat this condition, physicians give astro-\\nnauts motion sicknessmedication, such as lorazepam.\\nBone and muscle loss\\nIn zero-gravity conditions, astronauts lose bone\\nand muscle mass.

In Sanskrit,ayur means life or\\nliving,and vedameans knowledge, soAyurveda hasbeen\\ndefined as the ‘‘knowledge of living’’ or the ‘‘science of\\nlongevity.’’ Ayurvedic medicine utilizes diet,detoxifica-\\ntion and purification techniques, herbal and mineral\\nremedies, yoga, breathing exercises, meditation,a n d\\nmassage therapyas holistic healing methods. Ayurvedic\\nmedicine is widely practiced in modern India and has\\nbeen steadily gaining followers in the West.\\nPurpose\\nAccording to the original texts, the goal of\\nAyurveda is prevention as well as promotion of the\\nbody’s own capacity for maintenance and balance.\\nAyurvedic treatment is non-invasive and non-toxic, so\\nit can be used safely as an alternative therapy or along-\\nside conventional therapies. Ayurvedic physicians\\nclaim that their methods can also help stress-related,\\nmetabolic, and chronic conditions. Ayurveda has been\\nused to treatacne, allergies, asthma, anxiety, arthritis,\\nchronic fatigue syndrome, colds, colitis, constipation,\\ndepression, diabetes, flu, heart disease,hypertension,\\nimmune problems, inflammation, insomnia, nervous\\ndisorders, obesity, skin problems, and ulcers.\\nAyurvedic physicians seek to discover the roots\\nof a disease before it gets so advanced that more\\nradical treatments are necessary. Thus, Ayurveda\\nseems to be limited in treating severely advanced\\nconditions, traumatic injuries, acutepain, and con-\\nditions and injuries requiring invasive surgery.\\nAyurvedic techniques have also been used alongside\\nchemotherapyand surgery to assist patients in\\nrecovery and healing.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nAyurvedic medicine originated in the early civili-\\nzations of India some 3,000-5,000 years ago. It is\\nmentioned in theVedas, the ancient religious and\\nphilosophical texts that are the oldest surviving litera-\\nture in the world, which makes Ayurvedic medicine\\nthe oldest surviving healing system.

The basic life force in the body isprana,w h i c hi s\\nalso found in the elements and is similar to the Chinese\\nnotion ofchi. As Swami Vishnudevananda, a yogi and\\nexpert, put it, ‘‘Prana is in the air, but is not the oxygen,\\nnor any of its chemical constituents. It is in food, water,\\nand in the sunlight, yet it is not vitamin, heat, or light-\\nrays. Food, water, air, etc., are only the media through\\nwhich the prana is carried.’’\\nIn Ayurveda, there are five basic elements that\\ncontain prana: earth, water, fire, air, and ether.\\nThese elements interact and are further organized in\\nthe human body as three main categories or basic\\nphysiological principles in the body that govern all\\nbodily functions known as the doshas. The three\\ndoshas arevata, pitta, and kapha. Each person has a\\nunique blend of the three doshas, known as the per-\\nson’sprakriti, which is why Ayurvedic treatment is\\nalways individualized. In Ayurveda, disease is viewed\\nas a state of imbalance in one or more of a person’s\\ndoshas, and an Ayurvedic physician strives to adjust\\nand balance them, using a variety of techniques.\\nThe vata dosha is associated with air and ether,\\nand in the body promotes movement and lightness.\\nD E E P A K C H O P R A (1946– )\\n(AP/Wide World Photos. Reproduced by permission.)\\nDeepak Chopra was born in India and studied medi-\\ncine at the All India Institute of Medical Science. He left his\\nhome for the United States in 1970 and completed resi-\\ndencies in internal medicine and endocrinology. He went\\non to teaching posts at major medical institutions—Tufts\\nUniversity and Boston University schools of medicine—\\nwhile establishing a very successful private practice. By\\nthe time he was thirty-five, Chopra had become chief of\\nstaff at New England Memorial Hospital.\\nDisturbed by Western medicine’s reliance on medica-\\ntion, he began a search for alternatives and discovered one\\nin the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, an Indian\\nspiritualist who had gained a cult following in the late sixties\\nteaching Transcendental Meditation (TM). Chopra began\\npracticing TM fervently and eventually met the Maharishi.\\nIn 1985 Chopra established the Ayurvedic Health Center for\\nStress Management and Behavioral Medicine in Lancaster,\\nMassachusetts, where he began his practice of integrating\\nthe best aspects of Eastern and Western medicine.\\nIn 1993, he published Creating Affluence: Wealth\\nConsciousness in the Field of All Possibilities, and the enor-\\nmously successful best seller,Ageless Body, Timeless Mind.\\nIn the latter he presents his most radical thesis: that aging is\\nnot the inevitable deterioration of organs and mind that we\\nhave been traditionally taught to think of it as.

Diagnosis is\\noften taken over a course of days in order for the\\nAyurvedic physician to most accurately determine\\nwhat parts of the body are being affected. To diag-\\nnose problems, Ayurvedic physicians often use\\nlong questionnaires and interviews to determine a\\nperson’s dosha patterns and physical and psycholo-\\ngical histories.

An Ayurvedic diet can be a very well planned and\\nindividualized regimen. According to Ayurveda, there\\nare six basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter,\\nand astringent. Certain tastes and foods can either\\ncalm or aggravate a particular dosha. For instance,\\nsweet, sour, and salty decrease vata problems and\\nincrease kapha. Sour, salty, and pungent can increase\\npitta. After an Ayurvedic physician determines a per-\\nson’s dosha profile, they will recommend a specific\\ndiet to correct imbalances and increase health. The\\nAyurvedic diet emphasizes primarily vegetarian\\nfoods of high quality and freshness, tailored to the\\nseason and time of day. Cooling foods are eaten in\\nthe summer and heating ones in the winter, always\\nwithin a person’s dosha requirements. In daily routine,\\nthe heaviest meal of the day should be lunch, and\\ndinner should eaten well before bedtime, to allow for\\ncomplete digestion. Also, eating meals in a calm man-\\nner with proper chewing and state of mind is impor-\\ntant, as is combining foods properly and avoiding\\novereating.\\nCost\\nCosts of Ayurvedic treatments can vary, with\\ninitial consultations running anywhere from $40 to\\nover $100, with follow-up visits costing less. Herbal\\ntreatments may cost from $10 to $50 per month, and\\nare often available from health food or bulk herb\\nstores. Some clinics offer panchakarma, the intensive\\nAyurvedic detoxification treatment, which can include\\novernight stays for up to several weeks. The prices for\\nthese programs can vary significantly, depending on\\nthe services and length of stay. Insurance reimburse-\\nment may depend on whether the primary physician is\\na licensed M.D.\\nPreparations\\nAyurveda is a mind/body system of health that\\ncontains some ideas foreign to the Western scien-\\ntific model. Those people considering Ayurveda\\nshould approach it with an open mind and will-\\ningness to experiment. Also, because Ayurveda is a\\nwhole-body system of healing and health, patience\\nand discipline are helpful, as some conditions and\\ndiseases are believed to be brought on by years of\\nbad health habits and require time and effort to\\ncorrect. Finally, the Ayurvedic philosophy believes\\nthat each person has the ability to heal themselves,\\nso those considering Ayurveda should be prepared\\nto bring responsibility and participation into the\\ntreatment.\\nPrecautions\\nAn Ayurvedic practitioner should always be\\nconsulted.\\nSide effects\\nDuring Ayurvedic detoxification programs, some\\npeople report fatigue, muscle soreness, and general\\nsickness. Also, as Ayurveda seeks to release mental\\nstresses and psychological problems from the patient,\\nsome people can experience mental disturbances and\\ndepression during treatment, and psychological coun-\\nseling may be part of a sound program.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nBecause Ayurveda had been outside the Western\\nscientific system for years, research in the United\\nStates is new. Another difficulty in documentation\\narises because Ayurvedic treatment is very individua-\\nlized; two people with the same disease but different\\ndosha patterns might be treated differently. Much\\nmore scientific research has been conducted over the\\npast several decades in India. Much research in the\\nUnited States is being supported by the Maharishi\\nAyur-Ved organization, which studies the Ayurvedic\\nproducts it sells and its clinical practices.\\nSome Ayurvedic herbal mixtures have been pro-\\nven to have high antioxidant properties, much stron-\\nger thanvitamins A, C, and E, and some have also\\nbeen shown in laboratory tests to reduce or eliminate\\ntumors in mice and to inhibitcancer growth in human\\nlung tumor cells. In a 1987 study at MIT, an Ayurvedic\\nherbal remedy was shown to significantly reducecolon\\ncancer in rats. Another study was performed in the\\nNetherlands with Maharishi Ayur-Ved products. A\\ngroup of patients with chronic illnesses, including\\nasthma, chronic bronchitis, hypertension, eczema,\\npsoriasis, constipation, rheumatoid arthritis , head-\\naches, and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus,\\nwere given Ayurvedic treatment. Strong results were\\nobserved, with nearly 80% of the patients improving\\nand some chronic conditions being completely cured.\\nOther studies have shown that Ayurvedic therapies\\ncan significantly lower cholesterol and blood pressure in\\nstress-related problems. Diabetes, acne, and allergies\\nhave also been successfully treated with Ayurvedic reme-\\ndies. Ayurvedic products have been shown to increase\\nshort-term memory and reduce headaches.

By 1995, fewer than 500 cases of\\nbabesiosis had been reported in the United States.\\nThe disease occurs primarily in New England and\\nNew York, especially on the coastal islands.\\nHowever, cases have occurred in other parts of the\\nUnited States. Because of tick activity, the risk for\\nbabesiosis is highest during June and July.\\nTicks are small, blood-sucking arachnids.\\nAlthough some ticks carry diseasecausing organisms,\\nmost do not.Babesia microti is spread to humans\\nthrough the bite of the tickIxodes scapularis (also\\ncalled Ixodes dammini). Ixodes scapularis, called the\\n‘‘blacklegged deer tick,’’ usually feeds on deer and\\nmice. A tick picks up the parasites by feeding on an\\ninfected mouse and then passes them on by biting a\\nnew host, possibly a human. To pass on the parasites,\\nthe tick must be attached to the skin for 36-48 hours.\\nOnce in the bloodstream,Babesia microtienters a red\\nblood cell, reproduces by cell division, and destroys\\nthe cell, causing anemia. Humans infected with\\nBabesia microtiproduce antibodies that can be helpful\\nin diagnosing the infection.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBabesia microti live and divide within red blood\\ncells, destroying the cells and causing anemia. The\\nmajority of people who are infected have no visible\\nsymptoms. In those who become ill, symptoms appear\\none to six weeks following the tick bite. Because the\\nticks are small, many patients have no recollection of a\\ntick bite. The symptoms are flu-like and include tired-\\nness, loss of appetite, fever, drenching sweats, and\\nmuscle pain.

Today, the disease, caused by two ver-\\nsions of the same bacteria, is linked to homeless AIDS\\npatients and to those afflicted with cat-scratch disease.\\nThe infection is rarely seen today in patients who\\ndon’t have HIV. According to the U.S. Centers for\\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), an HIV\\npatient diagnosed with bacillary angiomatosis is con-\\nsidered to have progressed to full-blown AIDS.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nScientists have recently isolated two varieties of\\nthe Bartonella bacteria as the cause of bacillary angio-\\nmatosis:Bartonella (formerly Rochalimaea quintana)\\nand B. henselae(cause of cat-scratch disease).\\nB. quintanainfection is known popularly astrench\\nfever, and is the infection associated with body lice that\\nsickened European troops during World War I. Lice\\ncarry the bacteria, and can transmit the infection to\\nhumans. The incidence of trenchfever was believed to\\nhave faded away with the end of World War I. It was\\nnot diagnosed in the United States until 1992, when 10\\ncases were reported among homeless Seattle men.\\nThe related bacteriaB. henselae was first identi-\\nfied several years ago as the cause of cat-scratch fever.\\nIt also can lead to bacillary angiomatosis in AIDS\\npatients. Bacillary angiomatosis caused by this bac-\\nteria is transmitted to AIDS patients from cat fleas.\\nThese two different types of bacteria both cause\\nbacillary angiomatosis, a disease which is character-\\nized by wildly proliferating blood vessels that form\\ntumor-like masses in the skin and organs. The nodules\\nthat appear in bacillary angiomatosis are firm and\\ndon’t turn white when pressed. The lesions can occur\\nanywhere on the body, in numbers ranging from one\\nto 100. They are rarely found on palms of the hands,\\nsoles of the feet, or in the mouth. As the number of\\nlesions increase, the patient may develop a high fever,\\nsweats, chills, poor appetite,vomiting, and weight loss.\\nIf untreated, the infection may be fatal.\\nIn addition to the basic disease process, the two\\ndifferent types of bacteria cause some slightly different\\nsymptoms.

This may occur through a wound or\\ninfection, or through a surgical procedure or injec-\\ntion. Bacteremia may cause no symptoms and resolve\\nwithout treatment, or it may producefever and other\\nsymptoms of infection. In some cases, bacteremia\\nleads to septic shock, a potentially life-threatening\\ncondition.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nSeveral types of bacteria live on the surface of the\\nskin or colonize the moist linings of the urinary tract,\\nlower digestive tract, and other internal surfaces. These\\nbacteria are normally harmless as long as they are kept\\nin check by the body’s natural barriers and the immune\\nsystem. People in good health with strong immune\\nsystems rarely develop bacteremia. However, when\\nbacteria are introduced directly into the circulatory\\nsystem, especially in a person who is ill or undergoing\\naggressive medical treatment, the immune system may\\nnot be able to cope with the invasion, and symptoms of\\nbacteremia may develop. For this reason, bacteremia is\\nmost common in people who are already affected by or\\nbeing treated for some other medical problem. In addi-\\ntion, medical treatment may bring a person in contact\\nwith new types of bacteria that are more invasive than\\nthose already residing in that person’s body, further\\nincreasing the likelihood of bacterial infection.\\nConditions which increase the chances of devel-\\noping bacteremia include:\\n/C15immune suppression, either due to HIV infection or\\ndrug therapy\\n/C15antibiotic therapy which changes the balance of bac-\\nterial types in the body\\n/C15prolonged or severe illness\\n/C15alcoholism or other drugabuse\\n/C15malnutrition\\n/C15diseases or drug therapy that cause ulcers in the\\nintestines, e.g.chemotherapy for cancer\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 481\\nBacteremia'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 511, 'page_label': '512'}, page_content='Common immediate causes of bacteremia include:\\n/C15drainage of anabscess, including an abscessed tooth\\n/C15urinary tract infection, especially in the presence of a\\nbladder catheter\\n/C15decubitus ulcers (pressure sores)\\n/C15intravenous procedures using unsterilized needles,\\nincluding IV drug use\\n/C15prolonged IV needle placement\\n/C15use ofostomy tubes, includinggastrostomy(surgically\\nmaking a new opening into the stomach), jejunostomy\\n(surgically making an opening from the abdominal\\nwall into the jejunum), and colostomy (surgically\\ncreating an articifical opening into the colon).\\nThe bacteria most likely to cause bacteremia include\\nmembers of the Staphylococcus, Streptococcus,\\nPseudomonas,Haemophilus,and Esherichia coli(E. coli)\\ngenera.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of bacteremia may include:\\n/C15fever over 1018F (38.38C)\\n/C15chills\\n/C15malaise\\n/C15abdominal pain\\n/C15nausea\\n/C15vomiting\\n/C15diarrhea\\n/C15anxiety\\n/C15shortness of breath\\n/C15confusion\\nNot all of these symptoms are usually present.

As\\nmany as 10 to 26 percent of pregnant women in the\\nUnited States have BV; BV has been found in 12 to 25\\npercent of women in routine clinic populations, and in 32\\nto 64 percent of women in clinics forsexually transmitted\\ndiseases(STDs). BV is different than vaginal yeast infec-\\ntions and requires different methods of treatment.\\nIn most cases, BV does not have lasting effects on\\nwomen. However, there can be risks associated with BV:\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBacteria that dominate the vaginal flora in a BV\\ninfection includeGardnerella vaginalisor Mobiluncus,\\nalthough other bacteria, such asEscherichia colifrom\\nthe rectum have also been shown to cause the disease.\\nThe overgrowth of these harmful bacteria are at the\\nexpense of the protective bacteria lactobacilli, which\\nsecrete a natural disinfectant, hydrogen peroxide, that\\nmaintains the healthy, normal balance of vaginal\\nmicroorganisms. The factors that upset the normal\\nbalance of bacteria in the vagina are not well-under-\\nstood; however, the following activities or behaviors\\nthat have been associated with BV include:\\n/C15having a new sex partner or multiple sex partners\\n/C15stress\\n/C15douching\\n/C15using an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception\\nBV is not transmitted through toilet seats, bed-\\nding, swimming pools, or touching of objects. Women\\nwho have not had sexual intercourse rarely have BV.\\nHowever BV is not considered an STD, although it\\ndoes appear to act like an STD in women who have sex\\nwith women.\\nThe main symptom of BV is a thin, watery or\\nfoamy, white (milky) or gray vaginal discharge with\\nan unpleasant, foul, fish-like or musty odor. The odor\\nis sometimes stronger after a woman has sex, when the\\nsemen mixes with the vaginal secretions. Burning or\\npain during urination can also be present with BV.\\nItching on the outside of the vagina and redness can\\nalso occur, but are seen less frequently. However,\\nmany women with BV do not exhibit any symptoms.\\nDiagnosis\\nBV is diagnosed through a examination of the\\nvagina by a health care provider. A woman who sus-\\npects that she may have BV should not douche or use a\\nfeminine hygiene spray before the appointment with\\nthe health care provider. Laboratory tests are con-\\nducted on a sample of the vaginal fluid to see if the\\nbacteria present are those associated with BV. The\\nhealth care provider may also check to see if there is\\ndecreased vaginal acidity. Potassium hydroxide, when\\nadded to a vaginal discharge sample, enhances vaginal\\nodors and allows the health care provider to determine\\nif the odor is fishy or foul.\\nTreatment\\nIn a few cases, BV might clear up without treat-\\nment. However, all women with symptoms of BV\\nshould be treated to relieve symptoms and to avoid\\nthe development of complications such as pelvic inflam-\\nmatory disease (PID). In most cases, male partners are\\nnot treated, but female sexual partners should be exam-\\nined to see if they have BV and require treatment.\\nBV is treated with prescriptionantibiotics such as\\nmetronidazole or clindamycin creams or oral metronida-\\nzole (both are antibiotics that can also be used by preg-\\nnantwomen,althoughatdifferentdoses).Metronidazole\\nkills anaerobic bacteria but does not harm the protective\\nlactobacilli. Drinking alcohol should be avoided when\\ntaking metronidazole, for this medicine can cause severe\\nnausea and vomitingwhen combined with alcohol.\\nFor postmenopausal women, in addition to the\\nuse of antibiotics, the health care provider may also\\nprescribe estrogen suppositories or topical cream to\\nthicken and lubricate vaginal tissues.

Bad breath, either real or\\nimagined, can have a significant impact on a person’s\\nsocial and professional life.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBad breath can be caused by a number of pro-\\nblems. Oral diseases, fermentation of food particles in\\nthe mouth, sinus infections, and unclean dentures can\\nall contribute to mouth odor. Many non-oral diseases,\\nsuch as lung infections, kidney failure, or severeliver\\ndisease, can also cause bad breath, though rarely.\\nMany people think that bad breath can originate in\\nthe stomach or intestines; this is extremely rare. The\\nesophagus is usually collapsed and closed, and,\\nalthough a belch may carry odor up from the stomach,\\nthe chance of bad breath being caused from air con-\\ntinually escaping from the stomach is remote.\\nCigarette smoke can cause bad breath, not only in\\nthe cigarette smoker, but also in one who is constantly\\nexposed to second-hand smoke.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe easiest way to determine if one has bad breath\\nis to ask someone who is trustworthy and discrete.\\nThis is usually not too difficult. Another, more pri-\\nvate, method of determining if one has bad breath is to\\nlick one’s wrist, wait until it dries, then smell the area.\\nScraping the rear area of the tongue with a plastic\\nspoon, then smelling the spoon, is another method\\none can use to assess bad breath.\\nTreatment\\nThe most effective treatment of bad breath is to\\ntreat the cause. Poor oral hygiene can be improved by\\nregular brushing and flossing, as well as regular dental\\ncheckups. Gentle brushing of the tongue should be\\npart of dailyoral hygiene. In addition to good oral\\nhygiene, the judicious use of mouthwashes is helpful.\\nMouth dryness, experienced at night or duringfasting,\\nor due to certain medications and medical conditions,\\ncan contribute to bad breath. Dryness can be avoided\\nby drinking adequate amounts of water. Chewing gum\\nmay be beneficial.\\nAs mentioned, some medications, such as some\\nhigh blood pressure medications, can cause dry mouth.\\nIf this problem is significant, a medication change, under\\nthe supervision of one’s health care provider, may\\nimprove the dry-mouth condition. Oral or sinus infec-\\ntions, once diagnosed, can be treated medically, usually\\nwithantibiotics. Lung infections and kidney or liver\\nproblems will, of course, need medical treatment.\\nAlternative treatment\\nDepending on the cause, a multitude of alterna-\\ntive therapeutic remedies can be used. For example,\\nsinusitiscan be treated with steam inhalation of essen-\\ntial oils and/or herbs.\\nPrognosis\\nMost bad breath can be treated successfully with\\ngood oral hygiene and/or medical care. Occasionally,\\nfor patients who feel that these therapies are unsuccessful,\\nsome delusional or obsessivebehavior pattern might per-\\ntain, and mental health counseling may be appropriate.\\nResources\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nAmerican Dental Association. 211 E.

Balance and coordination depend on\\nthe interaction of multiple body organs and systems\\nincluding the eyes, ears, brain and nervous system, car-\\ndiovascular system, and muscles. Tests or examination\\nof any or all of these organs or systems may be necessary\\nto determine the causes of loss of balance,dizziness,o r\\nthe inability to coordinate movement or activities.\\nPurpose\\nTests of balance and coordination, and the exam-\\nination of the organs and systems that influence\\nbalance and coordination, can help to identify causes\\nof dizziness,fainting, falling, or incoordination.\\nPrecautions\\nTests for balance and coordination should be con-\\nducted in a safe and controlled area where patients will\\nnot experience injury if they become dizzy or fall.\\nDescription\\nAssessment of balance and coordination can\\ninclude discussion of the patient’s medical history and\\nac o m p l e t ephysical examinationincluding evaluation of\\nthe heart, head, eyes, and ears. A slow pulse or heart\\nrate, or very low blood pressure may indicate a circula-\\ntory system problem, which can cause dizziness or faint-\\ning. During the examination, the patient may be asked\\nto rotate the head from side to side while sitting up or\\nwhile lying down with the head and neck extended over\\nthe edge of the examination table. If these tests produce\\ndizziness or a rapid twitching of the eyeballs (nystag-\\nmus), the patient may have a disorder of the inner ear,\\nwhich is responsible for maintaining balance.\\nAn examination of the eyes and ears may also give\\nclues to episodes of dizziness or incoordination. The\\npatient may be asked to focus on a light or on a distant\\npoint or object, and to look up, down, left, and right\\nmoving only the eyes while the eyes are examined.\\nProblems with vision may, in themselves, contribute\\nto balance and coordination disturbances, or may\\nindicate more serious problems of the nervous system\\nor brain function.Hearing loss, fluid in the inner ear,\\nor ear infection might indicate the cause of balance\\nand coordination problems.\\nVarious physical tests may also be used. A patient\\nmay be asked to walk a straight line, stand on one foot,\\nor touch a finger to the nose to help assess balance.\\nThe patient may be asked to squeeze or push against\\nthe doctor’s hands, to squat down, to bend over, stand\\non tiptoes or stand on their heels. Important aspects of\\nthese tests include holding positions for a certain num-\\nber of seconds, successfully repeating movements a\\ncertain number of times, and repeating the test accu-\\nrately with eyes closed.

In balanitis, the head and foreskin become\\nred and inflamed. (In circumcised men, who lack a\\nforeskin, these symptoms only affect the tip of the\\npenis.) The condition often occurs due to the fungus\\nCandida albicans, the same organism that causes vagi-\\nnal yeast infections in women. Balanitis (which is also\\nreferred to as balanoposthitis) can be caused by a\\nvariety of other fungal or bacterial infections, or may\\noccur due to a sensitivity reaction to common chemi-\\ncal agents.\\nUncircumcised men are more at risk for balanitis\\ndue to the presence of the foreskin. The snug fit of the\\nforeskin around the top of the penis tends to create a\\ndamp, warm environment that encourages the growth\\nof microorganisms. Most of the organisms associated\\nwith balanitis are already present on the penis, but in\\nvery small numbers. However, if the area between the\\nhead and foreskin is not cleansed thoroughly on a\\nregular basis, these organisms can multiply and lead\\nto infection.\\nDiabetes can increase the risk of developing the\\ncondition.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBalanitis is usually a result of poor hygiene—for\\nexample, neglecting to bathe for several days. A failure\\nto properly wash (or rinse) the area between the head and\\nforeskin can lead to the development of fungal or bacter-\\nial infections that cause the condition. In other cases,\\nbalanitis may occur due to an allergic reaction: Some\\nKEY TERMS\\nMeniere’s disease—An abnormality of the inner ear\\nthat causes dizziness, ringing in the ears, and hear-\\ning loss.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 487\\nBalanitis'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 517, 'page_label': '518'}, page_content='men may be sensitive to chemicals found in harsh soaps,\\nlaundry detergents, or contraceptive creams. Men who\\ncontract a sexually transmitted disease (STD) such as\\ntrichimoniasis may also develop symptoms.\\nThe symptoms of balanitis are limited to the fore-\\nskin and head of the penis (in circumcised men, only\\nthe head is affected). These include redness, inflamma-\\ntion, pain, discharge, sore or itchy skin, and difficulty\\nretracting the foreskin.\\nDiagnosis\\nBalanitis is usually diagnosed based on a brief\\nphysical examination. This may be conducted by\\nyour regular health care provider or by a urologist,\\nthe type of doctor who specializes in such disorders.\\nThe doctor may take a sample of the discharge (if any)\\nto determine the nature of the possible infection.

Antibiotics are\\nused to treat bacterial infections, while topical antifun-\\ngals such as clotrimazole can combat balanitis caused by\\nCandida. If an allergic reaction is causing symptoms, the\\ngoal is to identify the chemical agent responsible.\\nOintments or creams may be used to ease skin irritation.\\nNo matter what the cause, it is important to thor-\\noughly clean the penis on a daily basis in order to\\nalleviate symptoms. If the condition keeps occurring,\\nor if the inflammation is interfering with urination,\\ncircumcision may be advised.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAccording to practitioners of alternative medi-\\ncine, certain herbs may be effective in controlling or\\npreventing yeast infections–a common cause of bala-\\nnitis.

It is\\nprimarily a disease of the tropics, although it is also\\nfound in cooler, temperate climates. Most persons\\nwith balantidiasis do not exhibit any noticeable symp-\\ntoms (asymptomatic), but a few individuals will\\ndevelopdiarrhea with blood and mucus and an\\ninflamed colon (colitis).\\nDescription\\nBalantidiasis is caused byBalantidium coli, a para-\\nsitic protozoan that infects the large intestine.B. coliis\\nthe largest and only protozoan, having cilia or hair-\\nlike structures, that is capable of causing disease in\\nKEY TERMS\\nAcidophilus— A bacteria believed to combat yeast\\ninfections.\\nCircumcision— The surgical removal of the\\nforeskin.\\nUrethral stricture— A narrowing of the urethra\\n(urine tube).\\n488 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBalantidiasis'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 518, 'page_label': '519'}, page_content='humans. Balantidiasis occurs most commonly in areas\\nwith poor sanitation and in settings where humans live\\nin close contact with pigs, sheep, or goats.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBalantidiasis is transmitted primarily by eating food\\nor drinking water that has been contaminated by human\\nor animal feces containingB. colicysts. During its life\\ncycle, this organism exists in two very different forms: the\\ninfective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot move but\\ncan survive outside the human body because of its thick,\\nprotective covering; and the disease-producing form, the\\ntrophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannot\\nsurvive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannot\\ninfect others. In the digestive tract, the cysts are trans-\\nported to the intestine where the walls of the cysts are\\nbroken open by digestive secretions, releasing the mobile\\ntrophozoites. Once released within the intestine, the tro-\\nphozoites multiply by feeding on intestinal bacteria or by\\ninvadingtheliningof the largeintestine.Within the lining\\nof the largeintestine, the trophozoites secrete a substance\\nthat destroys intestinal tissue and creates sores (ulcers) or\\nabscesses. Trophozoites eventually form new cysts that\\nare carried through the digestive tract and excreted in the\\nfeces. Under favorable temperature and humidity condi-\\ntions, the cysts can survive in soil or water for weeks to\\nmonths, ready to begin the cycle again.\\nMost individuals with balantidiasis have no\\nnoticeable symptoms. Even though these individuals\\nmay not feel ill, they are still capable of infecting\\nothers by person-to-person contact or by contaminat-\\ning food or water with cysts that others may ingest, for\\nexample, by preparing food with unwashed hands.\\nThe most common symptoms of balantidiasis are\\nchronic diarrhea or severe colitis with abdominal\\ncramps, pain, and bloody stools. Complications may\\ninclude intestinal perforation in which the intestinal\\nwall becomes torn, but the organisms do not spread to\\nother parts of the body in the blood stream.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of balantidiasis, as with other similar\\ndiseases, can be complicated, partly because symp-\\ntoms may or may not be present. A diagnosis of\\nbalantidiasis may be considered when a patient has\\ndiarrhea combined with a possible history of recent\\nexposure to amebiasis through travel, contact with\\ninfected persons, or anal intercourse.\\nSpecifically, a diagnosis of balantidiasis is made\\nby findingB. colicysts or trophozoites in the patient’s\\nstools or by finding trophozoites in tissue samples\\n(biopsy) taken from the large bowel. A diagnostic\\nblood test has not yet been developed.\\nStool examination\\nThis test involves microscopically examining a\\nstool sample for the presence of cysts and/or tropho-\\nzoites ofB. coli.\\nSigmoidoscopy\\nTo take a tissue sample from the large intestine, a\\nprocedure called a sigmoidoscopy is performed.\\nDuring a sigmoidoscopy, a thin, flexible instrument\\nis used to visually examine the intestinal lining and\\nobtain small tissue specimens.\\nTreatment\\nPatients with balantidiasis are treated with pre-\\nscription medication, typically consisting of a ten day\\ncourse of either tetracycline or metronidazole.\\nAlternative drugs that have proven effective in treat-\\ning balantidiasis include iodoquinol or paromomycin.\\nPrognosis\\nAlthough somewhat dependent on the patient’s\\noverall health, in general, the prognosis for most\\nKEY TERMS\\nAsymptomatic— Persons who carry a disease and\\nare usually capable of transmitting the disease but\\nwho do not exhibit symptoms of the disease are\\nsaid to be asymptomatic.\\nBiopsy— The removal of a tissue sample for diag-\\nnostic purposes.\\nCiliated— Covered with short, hair-like protru-\\nsions, like B. coli and certain other protozoa.

They are called aortic valve, pulmonary\\nvalve, mitral valve, and tricuspid valve. The valves\\nopen and close to regulate the blood flow from one\\nchamber to the next. They are vital to the efficient\\nfunctioning of the heart.\\nIn some people the valves are too narrow (a con-\\ndition called stenosis). Balloon valvuloplasty is per-\\nformed on children and adults to improve valve\\nfunction and blood flow by enlarging the valve open-\\ning. It is a treatment for aortic, mitral, and pulmonary\\nstenosis. Balloon valvuloplasty has the best results as a\\ntreatment for narrowed pulmonary valves. Results in\\ntreating narrowing of the mitral valve are generally\\ngood. It is more difficult to perform and less successful\\nin treating narrowing of the aortic valve.\\nDescription\\nBalloon valvuloplasty is a procedure in which a\\nthin tube (catheter) that has a small deflated balloon at\\nthe tip is inserted through the skin in the groin area\\ninto a blood vessel, and then is threaded up to the\\nopening of the narrowed heart valve. The balloon is\\ninflated, which stretches the valve open. This proce-\\ndure cures many valve obstructions. It is also called\\nballoon enlargement of a narrowed heart valve.\\nThe procedure is performed in a cardiac catheteriza-\\ntion laboratory and takes up to four hours. The patient is\\nusually awake, but is givenlocal anesthesiato make the\\narea where the catheter is inserted numb. After the site\\nwhere the catheter will be inserted is prepared and\\nanesthetized, the cardiologist inserts a catheter into the\\nappropriate blood vessel, then passes a balloon-tipped\\nKEY TERMS\\nCardiac catheterization— A technique used to\\nevaluate the heart and fix certain problems.\\nCatheterization is far less invasive than traditional\\nsurgery.\\nStenosis— The narrowing of any valve, especially\\none of the heart valves or the opening into the\\npulmonary artery from the right ventricle.\\nValve— Tissue in the passageways between the\\nheart’s upper and lower chambers that controls\\npassage of blood and prevents regurgitation.\\n490 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBalloon valvuloplasty'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 520, 'page_label': '521'}, page_content='catheter through the first catheter. Guided by a video\\nmonitor and an x ray, the physician slowly threads the\\ncatheter into the heart. The deflated balloon is posi-\\ntioned in the valve opening, then is inflated repeatedly.\\nThe inflated balloon widens the valve’s opening by split-\\nting the valve leaflets apart. Once the valve is widened,\\nthe balloon-tipped catheter is removed. The other cathe-\\nter remains in place for 6 to 12 hours because in some\\ncases the procedure must be repeated.\\nPreparation\\nFor at least six hours before balloon valvulo-\\nplasty, the patient will have to avoid eating or drinking\\nanything. An intravenous line is inserted so that med-\\nications can be administered. The patient’s groin area\\nis shaved and cleaned with an antiseptic. About an\\nhour before the procedure, the patient is given an\\noral sedative such as diazepam (Valium).\\nAftercare\\nAfter balloon valvuloplasty, the patient is sent to\\nthe recovery room for several hours, where he or she is\\nmonitored for vital signs (such as pulse and breathing)\\nand heart sounds. An electrocardiogram, which is a\\nrecord of the electrical impulses in the heart, is done.\\nThe leg in which the catheter was inserted is tempora-\\nrily prevented from moving. The skin condition is\\nmonitored. The insertion site, which will be covered\\nby a sandbag, is observed for bleeding until the cathe-\\nter is removed. Intravenous fluids will be given to help\\neliminate the x-ray dye; intravenous blood thinners or\\nother medications to dilate the coronary arteries may\\nbe given. Pain medication is available.\\nFor at least 30 minutes after removal of the cathe-\\nter, direct pressure is applied to the site of insertion; after\\nthis a pressure dressing will be applied. Following dis-\\ncharge from the hospital, the patient can usually resume\\nnormal activities. After balloon valvuloplasty lifelong\\nfollow-up is necessary because valves sometimes degen-\\nerate or narrowing recurs, making surgery necessary.\\nRisks\\nBalloon valvuloplasty can have serious complica-\\ntions. For example, the valve can become misshapen so\\nthat it doesn’t close completely, which makes the condi-\\ntionworse. Embolism,wherepiecesofthevalvebreakoff\\nand travel to the brain or the lungs, is another possible\\nrisk. If the procedure causes severe damage to the valve\\nleaflets, immediate surgery is required. Less frequent\\ncomplications are bleeding and hematoma (a local col-\\nlection of clotted blood) at the puncture site, abnormal\\nheart rhythms, reduced blood flow, heart attack, heart\\npuncture, infection, and circulatory problems.\\nResources\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nAmerican Heart Association. 7320 Greenville Ave. Dallas,\\nTX 75231.

This reduction in\\nbrain activity has to be balanced against the potential\\nside effects ofbarbiturates, which include allergic reac-\\ntions and effects on the cardiovascular system.\\nDescription\\nOne of the greatest hazards associated with brain\\ninjury is intracranial hypertension. Brain injury may be\\ncaused by an accidentalhead injuryor a medical condi-\\ntion, such as stroke, tumor, or infection. When the\\nbrain is injured, fluids accumulate in the brain, causing\\nit to swell. The skull does not allow for the expansion of\\nthe brain; in effect, the brain becomes compressed.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 491\\nBarbiturate-induced coma'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 521, 'page_label': '522'}, page_content='If the pressure does not abate, oxygenated blood\\nmay not reach all areas of the brain.

When choosing a surgeon to perform the\\noperation, patients should check with organizations\\nsuch as the American Society for Bariatric Surgery\\nfor certification. A patient also should ask about the\\nsurgeon’s experience in performing the particular\\noperation.\\nAlthough the number of obese teenagers and\\nresulting bariatric surgeries has increased, some\\nexperts are questioning the decision to perform\\nbariatric surgery on teens.

In the stomach, a strong\\nacid helps break down food so it can be digested\\nand the body can absorb the food’s nutrients and\\ncalories. The stomach can hold about three pints\\nof food at one time. As digestion continues, food\\nparticles become smaller and move from the stomach\\ninto the intestine. The various parts of the small\\nintestine are nearly 20 feet long if laid out straight.\\nThose food particles not digested in the small intes-\\ntine are stored in the large intestine until they are\\neliminated as waste.\\nWhen a patient has bariatric surgery, this diges-\\ntive process is altered to help the patient lose weight.\\nThere are three main types of bariatric surgery, but\\nonly two types are commonly used today. The types\\nare restrictive, malabsorptive, and combined restric-\\ntive/malabsorptive.\\nRestrictive surgery, often referred to as ‘‘sto-\\nmach stapling’’ uses bands or staples to create a\\nsmall pouch at the top of the stomach where food\\nenters from the esophagus. This smaller pouch may\\nhold only about 1 ounce of food at first and may\\nstretch to hold about 2-3 ounces. The pouch’s\\nlower opening is made small, so that food moves\\nslowly to the lower part of the stomach, adding to\\nthe feeling of fullness. The most frequently per-\\nformed types of restrictive surgeries are vertical\\nbanded gastroplasty (VBG), gastric banding, and\\nlaparoscopic gastric banding. VBG is used less\\ntoday in favor of gastric banding, which involves\\nan adjustable hollow band made of silicone rubber.\\nLaparoscopic gastric banding, or Lap-band, was\\napproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) in 2001. Sometimes referred to as ‘‘minimally\\ninvasive’’ bariatric surgery, the surgeon uses small\\nincisions and a laparoscope, or a small, tubular instru-\\nment with a camera attached, to see inside the abdo-\\nmen and apply the band.\\nMalabsorptive procedures help patients lose\\nweight by limiting the amount of nutrients and cal-\\nories the intestine can absorb.

The most common and successful com-\\nbined surgery in recent years is called the Roux-en-Y\\ngastric bypass (RGB). In this operation, the surgeon\\nfirst creates a small pouch at the top of the stomach.\\nNext, a Y-shaped section of the small intestine is con-\\nnected to the small pouch, allowing food to bypass the\\nlower stomach, the first part of the small intestine\\n(duodenum), and the first portion of the next section\\nof the small intestine ( jejunum). It connects into the\\nsecond half of the jejunum, reducing the amount of\\ncalories and nutrients the body absorbs.

Patients\\nshould have a consultation appointment with the\\nsurgeon prior to the procedure to discuss risks and\\nbenefits. Pre-operative instructions will be given that\\nwill tell the patient specific preparations prior to the\\nsurgery. These may include instructions about avoid-\\ning food or liquids, certainmedications, and other\\ninstructions on the day before or the day of the pro-\\ncedure.

The physician and nurses will\\nprovide instructions for wound care and other follow-\\nup when the patient is discharged from the hospital.\\nUsually, bariatric surgery patients can resume normal\\nactivity within about six weeks following surgery, and\\nas little as two weeks after laparoscopic procedures. It\\nis important for bariatric surgery patients to lose\\nweight at the recommended pace, takenutritional sup-\\nplements as recommended, and attend follow-up visits\\nwith physicians and nutritionists.\\nHow a patient complies with instructions from\\nphysicians following bariatric surgery is important.\\nMost patients will require lifelong use of nutritional\\nsupplements such as multivitamins, calcium, and other\\nvitamin supplements to prevent nutritional deficien-\\ncies. Because the stomach is smaller, patients will have\\nto eat small portions of food and often must avoid\\ncertain types of food such as sugar.\\nRisks\\nThe surgeon performing the procedure should\\ndiscuss its specific risks prior to surgery. Risks for\\nbariatric surgery include infection,blood clots, abdom-\\ninal hernia, gallstones, nutritional deficiencies, possi-\\nble nerve complications, anddeath. Death rates have\\nbeen reported lowest for RGB and VBG, at less than\\n1% of patients.\\nNormal results\\nWeight loss will occur gradually, as patients can\\neat less food and absorb fewer calories. When patients\\nfollow post-operative instructions, they can lead nor-\\nmal lives, eating less food and being careful to limit\\ncertain foods that may irritate their new stomach\\npouches. Most patients will lose 50–60% of their\\nexcess weight in the first year or two.

Odle\\nBarium enema\\nDefinition\\nA barium enema, also known as a lower GI (gas-\\ntrointestinal) exam, is a test that uses x-ray examina-\\ntion to view the large intestine. There are two types of\\nthis test: the single-contrast technique where barium\\nsulfate is injected into the rectum in order to gain a\\nprofile view of the large intestine; and the double-\\ncontrast (or ‘‘air contrast’’) technique where air is\\ninserted into the rectum.\\nPurpose\\nA barium enema may be performed for a variety of\\nreasons, including to aid in the diagnosis of colon and\\nrectal cancer(or colorectalcancer), and inflammatory\\ndisease. Detection of polyps (a benign growth in the\\ntissue lining of the colon and rectum), diverticula (a\\npouch pushing out from the colon), and structural\\nchanges in the large intestine can also be established with\\nthis test. The double-contrast barium enema is the best\\nmethod for detecting small tumors (such as polyps), early\\ninflammatory disease, and bleeding caused by ulcers.\\nThe decision to perform a barium enema is based\\non a person’s history of altered bowel habits. These\\ncan includediarrhea, constipation, any lower abdom-\\ninal pain they are currently exhibiting, blood, mucus,\\nor pus in their stools. It is also recommended that this\\nexam be used every five to 10 years to screen healthy\\npeople for colorectal cancer, the second most deadly\\ntype of tumor in the United States. Those who have\\na close relative with colorectal cancer or have had\\na precancerous polyp are considered to be at an\\nincreased risk for the disease and should be screened\\nmore frequently to look for abnormalities.\\nPrecautions\\nWhile barium enema is an effective screening\\nmethod in the detection of symptoms and may lead\\nto a timely diagnosis of several diseases, it is not the\\nonly method to do this. As of 1997, some studies have\\nshown that thecolonoscopy procedure performed by\\nexperienced gastroenterologists is a more accurate\\ninitial diagnostic tool for detecting early signs of color-\\nectal cancer. A colonoscopy is the most accurate way\\nfor the physician to examine the entire colon and\\nrectum for polyps. If abnormalities are seen at this\\ntime the procedure is accompanied by a biopsy.\\nSome physicians usesigmoidoscopy plus a barium\\nenema instead of colonoscopy.\\nDescription\\nTo begin a barium enema, the patient will lie with\\ntheir back down on a tilting radiographic table in order\\nto have x rays of the abdomen taken. After being\\nassisted to a different position, a well-lubricated rectal\\ntube is inserted through the anus. This tube allows the\\nphysician or assistant to slowly administer the barium\\ninto the intestine. While this filling process is closely\\nmonitored, it is important for the patient to keep the\\nanus tightly contracted against the rectal tube to help\\nmaintain its position and prevent the barium from\\nleaking.

Some survivors later\\ndeveloped a skin disease, called verruga peruana\\n(Peruvianwarts). These skin lesions were observed\\nprior to the 1871 outbreak–perhaps as far back as the\\npre-Columbian era–but a connection to Oroya fever\\nwas unknown. In 1885, a young medical researcher,\\nDaniel Carrion, inoculated himself with blood from a\\nlesion to study the course of the skin disease.

However, bartonellosis\\nrefers exclusively to the disease caused byB. bacillifor-\\nmis. The disease is limited to a small area of the Andes\\nMountains in western South America; nearly all cases\\nhave been in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. A large\\noutbreak involving thousands of people occurred in\\n1940–41, but bartonellosis has since occurred sporadi-\\ncally.

Although most chil-\\ndren between the ages of three and five begin to stay\\ndry at night, the age at which children are physically\\nand emotionally ready to maintain complete bladder\\ncontrol varies. Enuresis is a technical term that refers\\nto the continued, usually involuntary, passage of urine\\nduring the night or the day after the age at which\\ncontrol is expected.\\nDescription\\nMost children wet the bed occasionally, and defi-\\nnitions of the age and frequency at which bed-wetting\\nbecomes a medical problem vary somewhat. Many\\nresearchers consider bed-wetting normal until age 6.\\nAbout 10% of 6-year-old children wet the bed about\\nonce a month. More boys than girls have this problem.\\nThe American Psychiatric Association, however,\\ndefines enuresis as repeated voiding of urine into the\\nbed or clothes at age five or older. The wetting is usually\\ninvoluntary but in some cases it is intentional. For a\\ndiagnosis of enuresis, wetting must occur twice a week\\nfor at least three months with no underlying physio-\\nlogical cause. Enuresis, both nighttime (nocturnal) and\\ndaytime (diurnal), at age five affects 7% of boys and\\n3% of girls. By age 10, it affects 3% of boys and 2% of\\ngirls; only 1% of adolescents experience enuresis.\\nEnuresis is divided into two classes. A child with\\nprimary enuresis has never established bladder con-\\ntrol. A child with secondary enuresis begins to wet\\nafter a prolonged dry period. Some children have\\nboth nocturnal and diurnal enuresis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of bed-wetting are not entirely known.\\nIt tends to run in families. Most children with primary\\nenuresis have a close relative–a parent, aunt, or uncle–\\nwho also had the disorder. About 70% of children\\nwith two parents who wet the bed will also wet the\\nbed. Twin studies have shown that both of a pair of\\nidentical twins experience enuresis more often than\\nboth of a pair of fraternal twins.\\nSometimes bed-wetting can be caused by a serious\\nmedical problem like diabetes, sickle-cell anemia, or\\nepilepsy. Snoring and episodes of interrupted breath-\\ning during sleep (sleep apnea) occasionally contribute\\nto bed-wetting problems. Enlarged adenoids can cause\\nthese conditions. Other physiological problems, such\\nas urinary tract infection, severeconstipation,o rspinal\\ncord injury, can cause bed-wetting.\\nChildren who wet the bed frequently may have a\\nsmaller than normal functional bladder capacity.\\nFunctional bladder capacity is the amount of urine a\\nKEY TERMS\\nAcupressure— At e c h n i q u eu s i n gp r e s s u r et ov a r -\\nious points on the body to alleviate health problems.\\nADH— Antidiuretic hormone, or the hormone that\\nhelps to concentrate urine during the night.\\nBehavior modification— Techniques used to\\nchange harmful behavior patterns.\\nBladder— The muscular sac or container that stores\\nurine until it is released from the body through the\\ntube that carries urine from the bladder to the out-\\nside of the body (urethra).\\nDDAVP— Desmopressin acetate, a drug used to\\nregulate urine production.\\nHypnosis— The technique by which a trained pro-\\nfessional relaxes the subject and then asks ques-\\ntions or gives suggestions.\\nImipramine hydrochloride— A drug used to\\nincrease bladder capacity.\\nKidneys— A pair of organs located on each side of\\nthe spine in the lower back area.

When functional capacity is small, the\\nbladder will not hold all the urine produced during the\\nnight. Tests have shown that bladder size in these\\nchildren is normal. Nevertheless, they experience fre-\\nquent strong urges to urinate. Such children urinate\\noften during the daytime and may wet several times at\\nnight. Although a small functional bladder capacity\\nmay be caused by a developmental delay, it may also\\nbe that the child’s habit of voiding frequently slows\\nbladder development.\\nParents often report that their bed-wetting child is\\nan extremely sound sleeper and difficult to wake.\\nHowever, several research studies found that bed-\\nwetting children have normal sleep patterns and that\\nbed-wetting can occur in any stage of sleep.\\nRecent medical research has found that many\\nchildren who wet the bed may have a deficiency of\\nan important hormone known as antidiuretic hor-\\nmone (ADH). ADH helps to concentrate urine during\\nsleep hours, meaning that the urine contains less\\nwater and therefore takes up less space. This decreased\\nvolume of water usually prevents the child’s bladder\\nfrom overfilling during the night, unless the child\\ndrank a lot just before going to bed. Testing of\\nmany bed-wetting children has shown that these\\nchildren do not have the usual increase in ADH dur-\\ning sleep. Children who wet the bed, therefore, often\\nproduce more urine during the hours of sleep than\\ntheir bladders can hold. If they do not wake up, the\\nbladder releases the excess urine and the child wets\\nthe bed.\\nResearch demonstrates that in most cases bed-\\nwetting does not indicate that the child has a physical\\nor psychological problem. Children who wet the bed\\nusually have normal-sized bladders and have sleep\\npatterns that are no different from those of non-bed-\\nwetting children. Sometimes emotionalstress,s u c ha s\\nthe birth of a sibling, adeath in the family, or separa-\\ntion from the family, may be associated with the onset\\nof bed-wetting in a previously toilet-trained child.\\nDaytime wetting, however, may indicate that the pro-\\nblem has a physical cause.\\nWhile most children have no long-term problems\\nas a result of bed-wetting, some children may develop\\npsychological problems. Low self-esteem may occur\\nwhen these children, who already feel embarrassed,\\nare further humiliated by angry or frustrated parents\\nwho punish them or who are overly aggressive about\\ntoilet training. The problem can by aggravated when\\nplaymates tease or when social activities such as sleep-\\naway camp are avoided for fear of teasing.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf a child continues to wet the bed after the age of\\nsix, parents may feel the need to seek evaluation and\\ndiagnosis by the family doctor or a children’s specia-\\nlist (pediatrician). Typically, before the doctor can\\nmake a diagnosis, a thorough medical history is\\nobtained. Then the child receives aphysical examina-\\ntion, appropriate laboratory tests, including a urine\\ntest (urinalysis), and, if necessary, radiologic studies\\n(such as x rays).\\nIf the child is healthy and no physical problem is\\nfound, which is the case 90% of the time, the doctor\\nmay not recommend treatment but rather may pro-\\nvide the parents and the child with reassurance, infor-\\nmation, and advice.\\nTreatment\\nOccasionally a doctor will determine that the pro-\\nblem is serious enough to require treatment. Standard\\ntreatments for bed-wetting includebladder training\\nexercises, motivational therapy, drug therapy, psy-\\nchotherapy, and diet therapy.\\nBladder training exercises are based on the theory\\nthat those who wet the bed have small functional\\nbladder capacity. Children are told to drink a large\\nquantity of water and to try to prolong the periods\\nbetween urinations. These exercises are designed to\\nincrease bladder capacity but are only successful in\\nresolving bed-wetting in a small number of patients.\\nIn motivational therapy, parents attempt to\\nencourage the child to combat bed-wetting, but the\\nchild must want to achieve success.

Bed-wetting alarms require the motivation\\nof both parents and children. They are considered\\nthe most effective form of treatment now available.\\nA number of drugs are also used to treat bed-\\nwetting. These medications are usually fast acting;\\nchildren often respond to them within the first week\\nof treatment. Among the drugs commonly used are a\\nnasal spray of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), a sub-\\nstance similar to the hormone that helps regulate urine\\nproduction; and imipramine hydrochloride, a drug\\nthat helps to increase bladder capacity. Studies show\\nthat imipramine is effective for as many as 50% of\\npatients. However, children often wet the bed again\\nafter the drug is discontinued, and it has some side\\neffects. Some bed-wetting with an underlying physical\\ncause can be treated by surgical procedures. These\\ncauses include enlarged adenoids that cause sleep\\napnea, physical defects in the urinary system, or a\\nspinal tumor.\\nPsychotherapy is indicated when the child exhibits\\nsigns of severe emotional distress in response to events\\nsuch as a death in the family, the birth of a new child, a\\nchange in schools, or divorce. Psychotherapy is also\\nindicated if a child shows signs of persistently low self-\\nesteem or depression.\\nIn rare cases,allergies or intolerances to certain\\nfoods–such as dairy products, citrus products, or cho-\\ncolate–can cause bed-wetting. When children have food\\nsensitivities, bed-wetting may be helped by discovering\\nthe substances that trigger the allergic response and\\neliminating these substances from the child’s diet.\\nAlternative treatment\\nA number of alternative treatments are available\\nfor bed-wetting.\\nMassage\\nAccording to practitioners of this technique, pres-\\nsure applied to various points on the body may help\\nalleviate the condition.Acupressure or massage, when\\ndone by a trained therapist, may also be helpful in bed-\\nwetting caused by a neurologic problem.\\nHerbal and homeopathic remedies\\nSome herbal remedies, such as horsetail (Equisetum\\narvense) have also been used to treat bed-wetting. A\\ntrained homeopathic practitioner, working at the consti-\\ntutional level, will seek to rebalance the child’s vital force,\\neliminating the imbalanced behavior of bed-wetting.\\nCommon homeopathic remedies used in this treatment\\nincludeCausticum, Lycopodium,and Pulsatilla.\\nHypnosis\\nHypnosis is another approach that is being used\\nsuccessfully by practitioners trained in this therapy. It\\ntrains the child to awaken and go to the bathroom\\nwhen his or her bladder feels full. Hypnosis is less\\nexpensive, less time-consuming, and less dangerous\\nthan most approaches; it has virtually no side effects.\\nRecent medical studies show thathypnotherapy can\\nwork quickly–within four to six sessions.\\nPrognosis\\nOccasional bed-wetting is not a disease and it does\\nnot have a ‘‘cure.’’ If the child has no underlying\\nphysical or psychological problem that is causing the\\nbed-wetting, in most cases he or she will outgrow the\\ncondition without treatment. About 15% of bedwetters\\nbecome dry each year after age 6. If bed-wetting is\\nfrequent, accompanied by daytime wetting, or falls\\ninto the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic\\ndefinition of enuresis, a doctor should be consulted. If\\ntreatment is indicated, it usually successfully resolves\\nthe problem. Marked improvement is seen in about\\n75% of cases treated with wetness alarms.\\nPrevention\\nAlthough preventing a child from wetting the bed\\nis not always possible, parents can take steps to help\\nthe child keep the bed dry at night. These steps include:\\n/C15Encouraging and praising the child for staying dry\\ninstead of punishing when the child wets.\\n/C15Reminding the child to urinate before going to bed, if\\nhe or she feels the need.\\n/C15Limiting liquid intake at least two hours before\\nbedtime.\\nResources\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nAssociation for the Care of Children’s Health (ACCH). 7910\\nWoodmont Ave., Suite 300, Bethesda, MD 20814.

These tender or inflamed\\npatches develop when skin covering a weight-bearing\\npart of the body is squeezed between bone and another\\nbody part, or a bed, chair, splint, or other hard object.\\nDescription\\nEach year, about one million people in the\\nUnited States develop bedsores ranging from mild\\ninflammation to deepwounds that involve muscle\\nand bone. This often painful condition usually starts\\nwith shiny red skin that quickly blisters and deterio-\\nrates into open sores that can harbor life-threatening\\ninfection.\\nBedsores are not cancerous or contagious. They\\nare most likely to occur in people who must use wheel-\\nchairs or who are confined to bed.

These symptoms\\ninclude ulceration of the mouth or the genital area,\\nskin lesions, and inflammation of the uvea (an area\\naround the pupil of the eye).\\nDescription\\nBehcet’s syndrome is a chronic disease that\\ninvolves multiple body systems. The disease is named\\nfor a Turkish dermatologist, Hulusi Behcet, who first\\nreported a patient with recurrent mouth and genital\\nulcers along withuveitis in 1937. The disease occurs\\nworldwide, but is most prevalent in Japan, the Middle\\nEast, and in the Mediterranean region. There is a\\nwider prevalence among males than females in a\\nratio of two to one.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of Behcet’s syndrome is unknown.\\nSymptoms include recurring ulcers in the mouth or\\nthe genital area, skin lesions, arthritis that affects\\nmainly the knees and ankles,pain and irritation in\\nthe eyes, andfever. The mouth and genital ulcers tend\\nto occur in multiples and can be quite painful. In the\\nmouth, these ulcers are generally found on the ton-\\ngue, gums, and the inside of the lips or jaws. In the\\ngenital area, the ulcers usually occur on the penis and\\nscrotum in males and on the vulva of women. The eye\\ninflammation can lead to blindness.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause Behcet’s syndrome is a multisystem dis-\\nease, it is difficult to diagnose. International criteria\\nhave been proposed to assist in classifying this disease.\\nThere is no one diagnostic feature of this disease, so\\ndiagnosis depends on grouping together enough\\nsymptoms in order to identify the disease. Symptoms\\nof Behcet’s syndrome also occur in other diseases, so it\\nis often necessary to rule out the other diseases before\\na definitive diagnosis can be reached.\\nTreatment\\nSome of the current drugs used to treat Behcet’s\\nsyndrome include corticosteroids, cyclosporine,\\nazathioprine, chlorambucil, interferon alpha, thali-\\ndomide, levamisole and pulse cyclophosphamide.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for Behcet’s syndrome is generally\\npoor. There has been a documented case of Behcet’s\\nlasting for 17 years. Although the disease is considered\\npainful but not fatal, when the central nervous system is\\ninvolved there is usually severe disability anddeath\\noften occurs.

Unlike the better-known venereal\\nsyphilis, endemic syphilis is not a sexually trans-\\nmitted disease.\\nDescription\\nBejel has many other names depending on the\\nlocality: siti, dichuchwa, njovera, belesh, and skerljevo\\nare some of the names. It is most commonly found in\\nthe Middle East (Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq), Africa,\\ncentral Asia, and Australia. Bejel is related toyaws\\nand pinta, but has different symptoms.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nTreponema pallidum, the bacteria that causes\\nbejel, is very closely related to the one that causes the\\nsexually transmitted form of syphilis, but transmission\\nis very different. In bejel, transmission is by direct\\ncontact, with broken skin or contaminated hands, or\\nindirectly by sharing drinking vessels and eating uten-\\nsils.T. pallidumis passed on mostly between children\\nliving in poverty in very unsanitary environments and\\nwith poor hygiene.\\nThe skin, bones, and mucous membranes are\\naffected by bejel. Patches and ulcerated sores are com-\\nmon in the mouth, throat, and nasal passages.\\nGummy lesions may form, even breaking through\\nthe palate. Other findings may include a region of\\nswollen lymph nodes and deep bonepain in the legs.\\nEventually, bones may become deformed.\\nDiagnosis\\nT. pallidumcan be detected by microscopic study\\nof samples taken from the sores or lymph fluid.\\nHowever, since antibody tests don’t distinguish\\nbetween the types of syphilis, specific diagnosis of the\\ntype of syphilis depends on the patient’s history, symp-\\ntoms, and environment.\\nTreatment\\nLarge doses of benzathine penicillin G given by\\ninjection into the muscle can cure this disease in any\\nstage, although it may take longer and require\\nadditional doses in later stages. If penicillin cannot\\nbe given, the alternative is tetracycline. Since tetracy-\\ncline can permanently discolor new teeth still forming,\\nit is usually not prescribed for children unless no viable\\nalternative is available.\\nPrognosis\\nBejel is completely curable with antibiotic\\ntreatment.\\nKEY TERMS\\nRemission— When active symptoms of a chronic\\ndisease are absent.\\nUveitis— Inflammation of the area of the eye\\naround the pupil.\\n510 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBejel'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 540, 'page_label': '541'}, page_content='Prevention\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has\\nworked with many countries to prevent this and\\nother diseases, and the number of cases has been\\nreduced somewhat.

A tumor marker is a substance, made\\nby the body, that is linked to a certaincancer,o r\\nmalignancy. Bence Jones proteins are made by plasma\\ncells, a type of white blood cell. The presence of these\\nproteins in a person’s urine is associated with a malig-\\nnancy of plasma cells.\\nMultiple myeloma, a tumor of plasma cells, is the\\ndisease most often linked with Bence Jones proteins.\\nThe amount of Bence Jones proteins in the urine indi-\\ncates how much tumor is present. Physicians use Bence\\nJones proteins testing to diagnose the disease as well as\\nto check how well the disease is responding to\\ntreatment.\\nOther diseases involving cancerous or excessive\\ngrowth of plasma cells or cells similar to plasma cells\\ncan cause Bence Jones proteins in the urine. These\\ndiseases include: Waldenstro¨m’s macroglobulinemia,\\nsome lymphomas and leukemias, osteogenic sarcoma,\\ncryoglobulinemia, malignant B-cell disease,amyloidosis,\\nlight chain disease, and cancer that has spread to bone.\\nDescription\\nUrine is the best specimen in which to look for\\nBence Jones proteins. Proteins are usually too large to\\nmove through a healthy kidney, from the blood into\\nthe urine. Bence Jones proteins are an exception. They\\nare small enough to move quickly and easily through\\nthe kidney into the urine.\\nA routine urinalysis will not detect Bence Jones\\nproteins. There are several methods used by labora-\\ntories to detect and measure these proteins. The classic\\nBence Jones reaction involves heating urine to 1408F\\n(608C). At this temperature, the Bence Jones proteins\\nwill clump. The clumping disappears if the urine is\\nfurther heated to boiling and reappears when the\\nurine is cooled. Other clumping procedures using\\nsalts, acids, and other chemicals are also used to detect\\nthese proteins. These types of test will reveal whether\\nor not Bence Jones proteins are present, but not how\\nmuch is present.\\nA more complex procedure is done to measure the\\nexact amount of Bence Jones proteins. This proce-\\ndure–immunoelectrophoresis–is usually done on\\nurine that has been collected for 24-hours.\\nThe test is covered by insurance when medically\\nnecessary.

The test is also used to assess brain\\ndamage and neurological deficits. Individuals who\\nhave suffered a traumatic brain injury may be given\\nthe Bender-Gestalt as part of a battery of neuropsy-\\nchological measures, or tests.\\nThe Bender-Gestalt is sometimes used in conjunc-\\ntion with other personality tests to determine the pre-\\nsence of emotional and psychiatric disturbances such\\nas schizophrenia.\\nPrecautions\\nPsychometric testing requires a clinically trained\\nexaminer. The Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test\\nshould be administered and interpreted by a trained\\npsychologist or psychiatrist. The Bender-Gestalt should\\nalways be employed as only one element of a complete\\nbattery of psychological or developmental tests, and\\nshould never be used alone as the sole basis for a\\ndiagnosis.\\nDescription\\nThe original Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test was\\ndeveloped in 1938 by psychiatrist Lauretta Bender.\\nThere are several different versions of the Bender-\\nGestalt available today (i.e., the Bender-Gestalt test;\\nModified Version of the Bender-Gestalt test for\\nPreschool and Primary School Children; the Hutt\\nAdaptation of the Bender-Gestalt test; the Bender\\nVisual Motor Gestalt test for Children; the Bender-\\nGestalt test for Young Children; the Watkins Bender-\\nGestalt Scoring System; the Canter Background\\nInterference Procedure for the Bender-Gestalt test).\\nAll use the same basic test materials, but vary in their\\nscoring and interpretation methods.\\nThe standard Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test\\nconsists of nine figures, each on its own3 x 5 card.

For these\\npeople, benzodiazepines can help bring their feelings\\nunder control. The medicine can also relieve troubling\\nsymptoms of anxiety, such as pounding heartbeat,\\nbreathing problems, irritability,nausea, and faintness.\\nPhysicians may sometimes prescribe these drugs for\\nother conditions, such asmuscle spasms, epilepsy and\\nother seizure disorders,phobias, panic disorder,w i t h d r a -\\nwal from alcohol, and sleeping problems. However,\\nthis medicine should not be used every day for sleep\\nproblems that last more than a few days. If used this\\nway, the drug loses its effectiveness within a few weeks.\\nDescription\\nThe family of antianxiety drugs known as benzo-\\ndiazepines includes alprazolam (Xanax), chlordiazep-\\noxide (Librium), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam\\n(Ativan). These medicines take effect fairly quickly,\\nstarting to work within an hour after they are taken.\\nBenzodiazepines are available only with a physician’s\\nprescription and are available in tablet, capsule,\\nliquid, or injectable forms.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nbenzodiazepine, its strength, and the condition for\\nwhich it is being taken. Doses may be different for\\ndifferent people. Check with the physician who pre-\\nscribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the pre-\\nscription for the correct dosage.\\nKEY TERMS\\nNeuropsychological test— A test or assessment\\ngiven to diagnose a brain disorder or disease.\\nPerserveration— The persistence of a repetitive\\nresponse after the cause of the response has been\\nremoved, or the response continues to different\\nstimuli.\\nVisual-motor skills— Hand-eye coordination; in\\nthe Bender-Gestalt test, visual-motor skills are mea-\\nsured by the subject’s ability to accurately perceive\\nand then reproduce figures.\\nVisual-perceptual skills— The capacity of the mind\\nand the eye to ‘‘see’’ something as it objectively\\nexists.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 513\\nBenzodiazepines'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 543, 'page_label': '544'}, page_content='Always take benzodiazepines exactly as directed.\\nNever take larger or more frequent doses, and do not\\ntake the drug for longer than directed.

The English wordbereavement comes from an\\nancient Germanic root word meaning ‘‘to rob’’ or ‘‘to\\nseize by violence.’’Mourning is the word that is used to\\ndescribe the public rituals or symbols of bereavement,\\nsuch as holding funeral services, wearing black cloth-\\ning, closing a place of business temporarily, or low-\\nering a flag to half mast.Grief refers to one’s personal\\nexperience of loss; it includes physical symptoms as\\nwell as emotional and spiritual reactions to the loss.\\nWhile public expressions of mourning are usually\\ntime-limited, grief is a process that takes most people\\nseveral months or years to work through.\\nDescription\\nBereavement is a highly individual as well as a\\ncomplex experience. It is increasingly recognized that\\nno two people respond the same way to the losses\\nassociated with the death of a loved one. People’s\\nreactions to a death are influenced by such factors\\nas ethnic or religious traditions; personal beliefs\\nabout life after death; the type of relationship ended\\nby death (relative, friend, colleague, etc.); the cause of\\ndeath; the person’s age at death; whether the death\\nwas sudden or expected; and many others. In addi-\\ntion, the death of a loved one inevitably confronts\\nadults (and older adolescents) with the fact that they\\ntoo will die. As a result of this variety and emotional\\ncomplexity, most doctors and other counselors advise\\npeople to trust their own feelings about bereave-\\nment,0 and grieve in the way that seems most helpful\\nto them.\\nIt is also increasingly understood in the early\\n2000s that people can experience bereavement with\\nregard to other losses. Some examples of these\\n516 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBereavement'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 546, 'page_label': '547'}, page_content='so-called ‘‘silent losses’’ include miscarriages in early\\npregnancy, the death of a child in the womb shortly\\nbefore birth, or the news that a loved one has\\nAlzheimer’s disease or another illness that slowly\\ndestroys their personality. In addition, many counse-\\nlors recognize that bereavement has two dimensions,\\nthe actual loss and the symbolic losses. For example, a\\nperson whose teenage son or daughter is killed in an\\naccident suffers a series of symbolic losses—knowing\\nthat their child will never graduate from high school,\\nget married, or have children—as well as the actual\\nloss of the adolescent to death.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe immediate cause of bereavement is usually\\nthe death of a loved friend or relative. There are a\\nnumber of situations, however, which can affect or\\nprolong the grief process:\\n/C15The relationship with the dead person was a source\\nof pain rather than love and support. Examples\\nwould include an abusive parent or spouse.\\n/C15The person died in military service or in a natural,\\ntransportation, or workplace disaster. Bereavement in\\nthese cases is often made more difficult by intrusive\\nnews reporters as well asanxiety over the loved one’s\\npossible physical or mental suffering prior to death.\\n/C15The person was murdered. Survivors of homicide\\nvictims often find the criminal justice system as well\\nas the media frustrating and upsetting.\\n/C15The person is missing and presumed dead but their\\ndeath has not been verified. As a result, friends and\\nrelatives may alternate between grief and hope that\\nthe person is still alive.\\n/C15The person committed suicide. Survivors may feel\\nguilt over their inability to foresee or prevent the\\nsuicide, shame that the death was self-inflicted, or\\nanger at the person who committed suicide.\\n/C15The relationship with the dead person cannot be\\nopenly acknowledged. This situation often leads to\\nwhat is called disenfranchised grief. The most com-\\nmon instances are homosexual or extramarital sexual\\nrelationships that have been kept secret for the sake\\nof spouses or other family members.\\n/C15The loved one was an animal rather than a human\\nbeing. Western societies are only beginning to accept\\nthat adults as well as children can grieve for a dead\\nanimal; many adults still feel that there is ‘‘some-\\nthing wrong’’ about grieving for their pet. The ques-\\ntion of euthanasia may be an additional source of\\nsorrow; even when the pet is terminally ill, many\\npeople are very uneasy about making the decision\\nto end its life.\\nSymptoms\\nBereavement typically affects a person’s physical\\nwell-being as well as emotions. Common symptoms of\\ngrief include changes in appetite and weight,fatigue,\\ninsomnia and other sleep disturbances, loss of interest\\nin sex, low energy levels,nausea and vomiting, chest or\\nthroat pain, and headache. People who have lost a\\nloved one in traumatic circumstances may have such\\nsymptoms ofpost-traumatic stress disorderas an exag-\\ngerated startle response, visual or auditoryhallucina-\\ntions, or high levels of muscular tension.\\nDoctors and other counselors have identified four\\nstages or phases in uncomplicated bereavement:\\nColumbine High School students in Littleton, Colorado,\\ngrieving for their slain classmates.

Children do not\\nexperience bereavement in the same way as adolescents\\nand adults. Preschool children usually do not under-\\nstand death as final and irreversible, and may talk or act\\nas if the dead pet or family member will wake up or\\ncome back. Children between the ages of five and nine\\nare better able to understand the finality of death, but\\nthey tend to assume it will not affect them or their\\nfamily. They are likely to be shocked and severely\\nupset by a death in their immediate family. In addition\\nto the physical disturbances that bereaved adults often\\nexperience, children sometimes begin to act like infants\\nagain (wanting bottle feeding, using baby talk, etc.)\\nThis pattern of returning to behaviors characteristic of\\nan earlier life stage is called regression.\\nTRAUMATIC AND COMPLICATED GRIEF. Since the\\nearly 1990s, thanatologists (doctors and other counse-\\nlors who specialize in issues related to death and\\ndying) have identified two types of grief that do not\\nresolve normally with the passage of time. Traumatic\\ngrief is defined as grief resulting from a sudden trau-\\nmatic event that involves violent suffering, mutilation,\\nand/or multiple deaths; appears to be random or pre-\\nventable; and often involves the survivor’s own brush\\nwith death. The symptoms of traumatic grief are simi-\\nlar to those of post-traumaticstress disorder (PTSD).\\nSuch events as the terrorist attacks of September 11,\\n2001, the East Asian tsunami of December 2004, and\\nairplane crashes or other transportation disasters may\\nproduce traumatic grief in survivors.\\nIn contrast to traumatic grief, complicated grief\\ndoes not necessarily result from a specific type of event\\nbut rather refers to an abnormally intense and pro-\\nlonged response to bereavement. While most people\\nare able to move through a period of bereavement and\\nrecover a sense of purpose and meaning in life, people\\nwith complicated grief feel as if their entire worldview\\nhas been shattered. They cannot stop thinking of the\\ndead person, long to be with him or her, and may feel\\nthat part of them died along with the loved one. They\\nsometimes start acting like the deceased person,\\nmimicking the symptoms of his or her illness, behav-\\ning in reckless ways, talking about ‘‘joining’’ the loved\\none, or refusing to accept the reality of the death.\\nIn general they are unable to function normally.\\nComplicated grief should not be regarded as simply\\nKEY TERMS\\nBibliotherapy— The use of books (usually self-help\\nor problem-solving works) to improve one’s under-\\nstanding of personal problems and/or to heal pain-\\nful feelings.\\nBiofield healing— A general term for a group of\\nalternative therapies based on the belief that the\\nhuman body is surrounded by an energy field (or\\naura) that reflects the condition of the person’s\\nbody and spirit. Rebalancing or repairing the\\nenergy field is thought to bring about healing in\\nmind and body. Reiki, therapeutic touch, polarity\\nbalancing, Shen therapy, and certain forms of color\\ntherapy are considered forms of biofield healing.\\nComplicated grief— An abnormal response to\\nbereavement that includes unrelieved yearning for\\nthe dead person, the complete loss of previous\\npositive beliefs or worldviews, and a general inabil-\\nity to function.\\nDisenfranchised grief— Grief that cannot be\\nopenly expressed because the death or other loss\\ncannot be publicly acknowledged.\\nEuthanasia— The act of putting a person or animal\\nto death painlessly or allowing them to die by with-\\nholding medical services, usually because of a\\npainful and incurable disease.\\nMourning— The public expression of bereavement;\\nit may include funerals and other rituals, special\\nclothing, and symbolic gestures.\\nRegression— A return to earlier, particularly infan-\\ntile, patterns of thought and behavior.\\nThanatology— The medical, psychological, or\\nlegal study of death and dying.\\nTraumatic grief— Grief resulting from the loss of a\\nloved one in a traumatic situation (natural or transpor-\\ntation disaster, act of terrorism or mass murder, etc.)\\n518 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBereavement'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 548, 'page_label': '549'}, page_content='a subtype of clinical depression; the two conditions\\nmay coexist or overlap in some patients but are none-\\ntheless distinct entities.\\nDiagnosis\\nBereavement is considered a normal response to a\\ndeath or other loss. A doctor who suspects that a\\npatient is suffering from traumatic or complicated\\ngrief, however, may use various psychological inven-\\ntories or questionnaires to see whether the patient\\nmeets the criteria for PTSD, major depression, or\\nacute stress disorder. In addition, there are several spe-\\ncific questionnaires to help diagnose complicated grief.\\nTreatment\\nMost people do not require formal treatment\\nfor bereavement. In the early 2000s, however, many\\npeople choose to participate in support groups for\\nrecently bereaved people or hospice follow-up programs\\nfor relatives of patients who died in that hospice.\\nBereavement support groups are particularly helpful in\\nguiding members through such common but painful\\nproblems as disposing of the dead person’s possessions,\\ncelebrating holidays without the loved one, coping with\\nanniversaries, etc.\\nTraumatic grief is usually treated in the same way\\nas post-traumatic stress, with temporary use of medi-\\ncations to control sleep disturbances and anxiety\\nsymptoms along with long-term psychotherapy.\\nThose suffering from traumatic grief may also be\\nreferred to support groups of people dealing with the\\nsame type of sudden and violent loss. Some of these\\norganizations are listed below. Complicated grief is\\nusually managed with a combination of group and\\nindividual psychotherapy.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative therapies that have been reported to\\nhelp with the sleep disturbances and other physical\\nsymptoms of bereavement include prayer andmedita-\\ntion; such movement therapies asyoga and tai chi;\\ntherapeutic touch, Reiki, and other forms of biofield\\nhealing; bibliotherapy and journaling;music therapy,\\nart therapy, hydrotherapy,a n dmassage therapy.\\nPrognosis\\nMost people move through the stages of the nor-\\nmal grief process within several months to two years,\\ndepending on the length and closeness of the relation-\\nship. Traumatic grief and complicated grief, however,\\nmay take three years or longer to resolve, even with\\nappropriate treatment.\\nPrevention\\nBereavement is considered a normal response to\\ndeath and loss, which are universal human experi-\\nences. It should ordinarily be allowed to run its course;\\nmost counselors maintain that trying to stifle or cut\\nshort the grief process is more likely to cause emo-\\ntional problems later on than to prevent them.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.Diagnostic and Statistical\\nManual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision.\\nWashington, DC: American Psychiatric Association,\\n2000.\\nDossey, Larry, MD.Healing Beyond the Body: Medicine and\\nthe Infinite Reach of the Mind.Boston and London:\\nShambhala, 2001.

Beriberi literally means ‘‘I can’t, I\\ncan’t’’ in Singhalese, which reflects the crippling effect\\nit has on its victims. It is common in parts of southeast\\nAsia, where white rice is the main food. In the United\\nStates, beriberi is primarily seen in people with chronic\\nalcoholism.\\nDescription\\nBeriberi puzzled medical experts for years as it\\nravaged people of all ages in Asia. Doctors thought it\\nwas caused by something in food. Not until the early\\n1900s did scientists discover that rice bran, the outer\\ncovering that was removed to create the polished white\\nrice preferred by Asians, actually contained something\\nthat prevented the disease. Thiamine was the first\\nvitamin identified. In the 1920s, extracts of rice polish-\\nings were used to treat the disease.\\nIn adults, there are different forms of beriberi,\\nclassified according to the body systems most affected.\\nDry beriberi involves the nervous system; wet beriberi\\naffects the heart and circulation. Both types usually\\noccur in the same patient, with one set of symptoms\\npredominating.\\nA less common form of cardiovascular, or wet\\nberiberi, is known as ‘‘shoshin.’’ This condition\\ninvolves a rapid appearance of symptoms and acute\\nheart failure. It is highly fatal and is known to cause\\nsudden death in young migrant laborers in Asia whose\\ndiet consists of white rice.\\nCerebral beriberi, also known as Wernicke-\\nKorsakoff syndrome, usually occurs in chronic alco-\\nholics and affects the central nervous system (brain\\nand spinal cord). It can be caused by a situation that\\naggravates a chronic thiamine deficiency, like an alco-\\nholic binge or severevomiting.\\nInfantile beriberi is seen in breastfed infants of\\nthiamine-deficient mothers, who live in developing\\nnations.\\nAlthough severe beriberi is uncommon in the\\nUnited States, less severe thiamine deficiencies do\\noccur. About 25% of all alcoholics admitted to a\\nhospital in the United States show some evidence of\\nthiamine deficiency.\\n520 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBeriberi'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 550, 'page_label': '551'}, page_content='Causes and symptoms\\nThiamine is one of the Bvitamins and plays an\\nimportant role in energy metabolism and tissue build-\\ning. It combines with phosphate to form the coenzyme\\nthiamine pyrophosphate (TPP),which is essential in\\nreactions that produce energy from glucose or that\\nconvert glucose to fat for storage in the tissues.\\nWhen there is not enough thiamine in the diet, these\\nbasic energy functions are disturbed, leading to pro-\\nblems throughout the body.\\nSpecial situations, such as an over-active meta-\\nbolism, prolonged fever, pregnancy, and breastfeed-\\ning, can increase the body’s thiamine requirements\\nand lead to symptoms of deficiency. Extended peri-\\nods ofdiarrhea or chronic liver disease can result in\\nthe body’s inability to maintain normal levels of\\nmany nutrients, including thiamine. Other persons\\nat risk are patients with kidney failure on dialysis\\nand those with severe digestive problems who are\\nunable to absorb nutrients. Alcoholics are susceptible\\nbecause they may substitute alcohol for food and\\ntheir frequent intake of alcohol decreases the body’s\\nability to absorb thiamine.\\nThe following systems are most affected by\\nberiberi:\\n/C15Gastrointestinal system. When the cells of the\\nsmooth muscles in the digestive system and glands\\ndo not get enough energy from glucose, they are\\nunable to produce more glucose from the normal\\ndigestion of food. There is a loss of appetite,indiges-\\ntion, severeconstipation, and a lack of hydrochloric\\nacid in the stomach.\\n/C15Nervous System. Glucose is essential for the central\\nnervous system to function normally. Early defi-\\nciency symptoms arefatigue, irritability, and poor\\nmemory. If the deficiency continues, there is damage\\nto the peripheral nerves that causes loss of sensation\\nand muscle weakness, which is calledperipheral neu-\\nropathy. The legs are most affected. The toes feel\\nnumb and the feet have a burning sensation; the leg\\nmuscles become sore and the calf muscles cramp. The\\nindividual walks unsteadily and has difficulty getting\\nup from a squatting position. Eventually, the muscles\\nshrink (atrophy) and there is a loss of reflexes in the\\nknees and feet; the feet may hang limp (footdrop).\\n/C15Cardiovascular system. There is a rapid heartbeat\\nand sweating. Eventually the heart muscle weakens.\\nBecause the smooth muscle in the blood vessels is\\naffected, the arteries and veins relax, causing swel-\\nling, known asedema, in the legs.\\n/C15Musculoskeletal system. There is widespread mus-\\ncle pain caused by the lack of TPP in the muscle\\ntissue.\\nInfants who are breastfed by a thiamine-\\ndeficient mother usually develop symptoms of\\ndeficiency between the second and fourth month of\\nlife. They are pale, restless, unable to sleep, prone\\nto diarrhea, and have muscle wasting and edema in\\ntheir arms and legs. They have a characteristic,\\nsometimes silent, cry and develop heart failure and\\nnerve damage.\\nDiagnosis\\nA physical examination will reveal many of the\\nearly symptoms of beriberi, such as fatigue, irrita-\\ntion,nausea, constipation, and poor memory, but\\nthe deficiency may be difficult to identify.\\nInformation about the individual’s diet and general\\nhealth is also needed.\\nThere are many biochemical tests based on thia-\\nmine metabolism or the functions of TPP that can\\ndetect a thiamine deficiency.

Observing\\nimprovements in the patient after giving thiamine\\nsupplements will also confirm the diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment with thiamine reverses the deficiency in\\nthe body and relieves most of the symptoms. Severe\\nthiamine deficiency is treated with high doses of thia-\\nmine given by injection into a muscle (intramuscular)\\nor in a solution that goes into a vein (intravenously)\\nfor several days.

Additional supple-\\nments of B vitamins, a multivitamin and mineral\\ncomplex, and Vitamin C are also recommended.\\nOther alternative therapies may help relieve the per-\\nson’s symptoms after the thiamine deficiency is\\ncorrected.\\nPrognosis\\nBeriberi is fatal if not treated and the longer the\\ndeficiency exists, the sicker the person becomes. Most\\nof the symptoms can be reversed and full recovery is\\npossible when thiamine levels are returned to normal\\nand maintained with a balanced diet and vitamin sup-\\nplements as needed.\\nPrevention\\nA balanced diet containing all essential nutrients\\nwill prevent a thiamine deficiency and the develop-\\nment of beriberi. People who consume large quantities\\nof junk food like soda, pretzels, chips, candy, and high\\ncarbohydrate foods made with unenriched flours may\\nbe deficient in thiamine and other vital nutrients. They\\nmay need to take vitamin supplements and should\\nimprove theirdiets.\\nDietary Requirements\\nThe body’s requirements for thiamine are tied\\nto carbohydrate metabolism and expressed in terms\\nof total intake of calories. The current recom-\\nmended dietary allowances (RDA) are 0.5 mg for\\nevery 1000 calories, witha minimum daily intake\\nof 1 mg even for those who eat fewer than 2,000\\ncalories in a day. The RDA for children and teen-\\nagers is the same as for adults: 1.4 mg daily for\\nmales over age eleven, and 1.1 mg for females.\\nDuring pregnancy, an increase to 1.5 mg daily is\\nneeded. Because of increased energy needs and the\\nsecretion of thiamine in breast milk, breast feeding\\nmothers need 1.5 mg every day.

Found in rocks, coal, soil, and volcanic\\ndust, beryllium is used in the aerospace industry and\\nin many types of manufacturing. Berylliosis occurs in\\nboth acute and chronic forms. In some cases, appear-\\nance of the disease may be delayed as much as 20 years\\nafter exposure to beryllium.\\nDescription\\nIn the 1930s, scientists discovered that beryllium\\ncould make fluorescent light bulbs last longer. During\\nthe following decade, the hard, grayish metal was\\nidentified as the cause of a potentially debilitating,\\nsometimes deadly disease characterized byshortness\\nof breathand inflammation, swelling, and scarring of\\nthe lungs.\\nThe manufacture of fluorescent light bulbs is no\\nlonger a source of beryllium exposure, but serious\\nhealth hazards are associated with any work\\nenvironment or process in which beryllium fumes or\\nparticles become airborne.

This condition is caused by beryllium air pol-\\nlution that inflames the lungs making them rigid; it can\\naffect the eyes and skin as well. People who have acute\\nberylliosis are usually very ill.

Testing is done primarily when\\nevaluating a person for certain kinds ofcancer affect-\\ning white blood cells including chronic lymphocytic\\nleukemia, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, andmultiple\\nmyeloma or kidney disease.\\nPurpose\\nBeta2-microglobulin is plentiful on the surface of\\nwhite blood cells. Increased production or destruction\\nof these cells causes Beta2-microglobulin levels in the\\nblood to increase. This increase is seen in people with\\ncancers involving white blood cells, but it is particu-\\nlarly meaningful in people newly diagnosed with mul-\\ntiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a malignancy\\n(cancer) of a certain kind of white blood cell, called a\\nplasma cell. At the time of diagnosis, the Beta2-micro-\\nglobulin levels reflect how advanced the disease is and\\nthe likely prognosis for that person.\\nWhen kidney disease is suspected, comparing\\nblood and urine levels helps identify where the kidney\\nis damaged. Beta2-microglobulin normally is filtered\\nout of the blood by the kidney’s glomeruli (a round\\nmass of capillary loops leading to each kidney tubule),\\nonly to be partially reabsorbed back into the blood\\nwhen it reaches the kidney’s tubules. In glomerular\\nkidney disease, the glomeruli can’t filter it out of the\\nblood, so levels increase in the blood and decrease in\\nthe urine. In tubular kidney disease, the tubules can’t\\nreabsorb it back into the blood, so urine levels rise and\\nblood levels fall. After a kidney transplant, increased\\nblood levels may be an early sign of rejection.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 527\\nBeta2-microglobulin test'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 557, 'page_label': '558'}, page_content='Increased urinary levels are found in people with\\nkidney damage caused by high exposure to the heavy\\nmetals cadmium and mercury.

It is a rare tumor with poor\\noutcome for most patients.\\nDescription\\nBile is a substance manufactured by the liver that\\naids in the digestion of food. Bile ducts are channels\\nthat carry the bile from the liver to the small intestine.\\nLike the tributaries of a river, the small bile ducts in\\nthe liver converge into two large bile ducts called the\\nleft and right hepatic ducts. These exit the liver and\\njoin to form the common hepatic duct. The gallblad-\\nder, which concentrates and stores the bile, empties\\ninto the common hepatic duct to form the common\\nbile duct. Finally, this large duct connects to the small\\nintestine where the bile can help digest food.\\nCollectively, this network of bile ducts is called the\\nbiliary tract.\\nBile duct cancer originates from the cells that line\\nthe inner surface of the bile ducts. A tumor may arise\\nanywhere along the biliary tract, either within or out-\\nside of the liver. Bile duct tumors are typically slow-\\ngrowing tumors that spread by local invasion of neigh-\\nboring structures and by way of lymphatic channels.\\nBile duct cancer is an uncommon malignancy. In\\nthe United States, approximately one case arises per\\n100,000 people per year, but it is more common in\\nSoutheast Asia. It occurs in men only slightly more\\noften than in women and it is most commonly diag-\\nnosed in people in their 50s and 60s. In fact, about\\n65% of patients with bile duct cancer are over age 65.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA number of risk factors are associated with the\\ndevelopment of bile duct cancer:\\n/C15Primary sclerosingcholangitis. This disease is char-\\nacterized by extensive scarring of the biliary tract,\\nsometimes associated with inflammatory bowel\\ndisease.\\n/C15Choledochal cysts. These are abnormal dilatations of\\nthe biliary tract that usually form during fetal devel-\\nopment. There is evidence that these cysts may rarely\\narise during adulthood.\\n/C15Hepatolithiasis. This is the condition of stone forma-\\ntion within the liver (not including gallbladder stones).\\n/C15Liver flukes. Parasitic infection with certain worms is\\nthought to be at least partially responsible for the\\nhigher prevalence of bile duct cancer in Southeast\\nAsia.\\n/C15Thorotrast. This is a chemical that was previously\\ninjected intravenously during certain types of x rays.\\nIt is not in use anymore. Exposure to Thorotrast has\\nbeen implicated in the development of cancer of the\\nliver as well as the bile ducts.\\nSymptoms\\nJaundice is the first symptom in 90% of patients.\\nThis occurs when the bile duct tumor causes an\\nobstruction in the normal flow of bile from the liver\\nto the small intestine. Bilirubin, a component of bile,\\nbuilds up within the liver and is absorbed into the\\nbloodstream in excess amounts. This can be detected\\nin a blood test, but it can also manifest as yellowish\\ndiscoloring of the skin and eyes. The bilirubin in the\\nbloodstream also makes the urine appear dark.\\nAdditionally, the patient may experience generalized\\nitching due to the deposition of bile components in the\\nskin. Normally, a portion of the bile is excreted in\\nstool; bile actually gives stool its brown color. But\\nwhen the biliary tract is obstructed by tumor, the\\nstools may appear pale.\\nAbdominal pain, fatigue, weight loss, and poor\\nappetite are less common symptoms.

Sometimes the biliary tract can\\nbecome infected, but this is normally a rare conse-\\nquence of invasive tests. Infection causesfever, chills,\\nand pain in the right upper portion of the abdomen.\\nDiagnosis\\nCertain laboratory tests of the blood may aid in\\nthe diagnosis. The most important one is the test for\\nelevated bilirubin levels in the bloodstream. Levels of\\nalkaline phosphatase and CA 19-9 may also be\\nelevated.\\nWhen symptoms, physical signs, and blood tests\\npoint toward an abnormality of the biliary tract, the\\nnext step involves radiographic exams. Ultrasound,\\ncomputed tomography (CT scan), andmagnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI) are noninvasive and rapid. In\\nrecent years, MRI has become the favored imaging\\nchoice for initial diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma\\nwhen the exam is available and affordable or covered\\nby insurance. These tests can often detect the actual\\ntumor as well as dilatation of the obstructed biliary\\ntract. If these tests indicate the presence of a tumor,\\ncholangiography is required. This procedure involves\\ninjecting dye into the biliary tract to obtain anatomic\\nimages of the bile ducts and the tumor. The specialist\\nthat performs this test can also insert small tubes, or\\nstents, into a partially obstructed portion of the bile\\nduct to prevent further obstruction by growth of the\\ntumor. This is vitally important since it may be the\\nonly intervention that is possible in certain patients.\\nCholangiography is an invasive test that carries a\\nsmall risk of infection of the biliary tract. The objective\\nof these radiological tests is to determine the size and\\nlocation of the tumor, as well as the extent of spread to\\nnearby structures.\\nThe treatment of bile duct tumors is usually not\\naffected by the specific type of cancer cells that com-\\nprise the tumor. For this reason, some physicians\\nforego biopsy of the tumor.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment is with surgical resection (removal)\\nof the tumor and all involved structures. Unfortunately,\\nsometimes the cancer has already spread too far when\\nthe diagnosis is made. Thus, in the treatment of bile\\nduct cancer, the first question to answer is if the tumor\\nmay be safely resected by surgery with reasonable\\nbenefit to the patient. If the cancer involves\\ncertain blood vessels or has spread widely throughout\\nthe liver, resection may not be possible. Sometimes\\nfurther invasive testing is required.\\nAngiography can determine if the blood vessels are\\ninvolved. Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that\\nallows the surgeon to directly assess the tumor and\\nnearby lymph nodes without making a large incision\\nin the abdomen. Only about 45% of bile duct cancers\\nare ultimately resectable.\\nIf the tumor is resectable, and the patient is\\nhealthy enough to tolerate the operation, the specific\\ntype of surgery performed depends on the location of\\nthe tumor. For tumors within the liver or high up in\\nthe biliary tract, resection of part of the liver may be\\nrequired. Tumors in the middle portion of the biliary\\ntract can be removed alone. Tumors of the lower end\\nof the biliary tract may require extensive resection of\\npart of the pancreas, small intestine, and stomach to\\nensure complete resection.\\nUnfortunately, sometimes the cancer appears\\nresectable by all the radiological and invasive tests,\\nbut is found to be unresectable during surgery. In\\nthis scenario, a bypass operation can relieve the biliary\\ntract obstruction, but does not remove the tumor\\nitself. This does not produce a cure but it can offer a\\nbetter quality of life for the patient.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis depends on the stage and resectability\\nof the tumor. If the patient cannot undergo surgical\\nresection, the survival rate is commonly less than one\\nyear. If the tumor is resected, the survival rate\\nimproves, with 20% of these patients surviving past\\nfive years.\\nClinical trials\\nStudies of new treatments in patients are known as\\nclinical trials. These trials seek to compare the stan-\\ndard method of care with a new method, or the trials\\nmay be trying to establish whether one treatment is\\nmore beneficial for certain patients than others.\\nSometimes, a new treatment that is not being offered\\non a wide scale may be available to patients participat-\\ning in clinical trials, but participating in the trials may\\ninvolve some risk.

Half of all liver transplants are\\ndone for this reason.\\nThe normal anatomy of the bile system begins\\nwithin the liver, where thousands of tiny bile ducts\\ncollect bile from liver cells. These ducts merge into\\nlarger and larger channels, like streams flowing into\\nrivers, until they all pour into a single duct that empties\\ninto the duodenum (first part of the small intestine).\\nBetween the liver and the duodenum this duct has a side\\nchannel connected to the gall bladder. The gall bladder\\nstores bile and concentrates it, removing much of its\\nwater content. Then, when a meal hits the stomach, the\\ngall bladder contracts and empties its contents.\\nBile is a mixture of waste chemicals that the liver\\nremoves from the circulation and excretes through the\\nbiliary system into the intestine. On its way out, bile\\nassists in the digestion of certain nutrients. If bile\\ncannot get out because the channels are absent or\\nblocked, it backs up into the liver and eventually into\\nthe rest of the body. The major pigment in bile is a\\nchemical called bilirubin, which is yellow. Bilirubin is a\\nbreakdown product of hemoglobin (the red chemical\\nin blood that carries oxygen). If the body accumulates\\nan excess of bilirubin, it turns yellow (jaundiced). Bile\\nalso turns the stool brown. Without it, stools are the\\ncolor of clay.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIt is possible that a viral infection is responsible\\nfor this disease, but evidence is not yet convincing. The\\ncause remains unknown.\\nThe affected infant will appear normal at birth\\nand during the newborn period. After two weeks the\\nnormaljaundice of the newborn will not disappear,\\nand the stools will probably be clay-colored. At this\\npoint, the condition will come to the attention of a\\nphysician. If not, the child’s abdomen will begin to\\nswell, and the infant will get progressively more ill.\\nNearly all untreated children will die of liver failure\\nwithin two years.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe persistence of jaundice beyond the second\\nweek in a newborn with clay-colored stools is a sure\\nsign of obstruction to the flow of bile. An immediate\\nevaluation that includes blood tests and imaging of the\\nbiliary system will confirm the diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nSurgery is the only treatment. Somehow the sur-\\ngeon must create an adequate pathway for bile to\\nescape the liver into the intestine.

More likely, the upper\\nbiliary system will also be inadequate, and the surgeon\\nwill attach a piece of intestine directly to the liver–the\\nKasai procedure.

Bile\\nwill begin to flow in that direction, and the channels\\nwill gradually enlarge. Survival rates for the Kasai\\nprocedure are commonly 50% at five years and 15%\\nat 10 years.

The binge eater\\nconsumes unnaturally large amounts of food in a short\\ntime period, but unlike a bulimic, does not regularly\\nengage in any inappropriate weight-reducing beha-\\nviors (for example, excessiveexercise, vomiting, taking\\nlaxatives) following the binge episodes.\\nDescription\\nBED typically strikes individuals sometime between\\nadolescence and the early twenties. Because of the nat-\\nure of the disorder, most BED patients are overweight\\nor obese. Studies of weight loss programs have shown\\nthat an average of 30% of individuals enrolling in these\\nprograms report binge eating behavior.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBinge eating episodes may act as a psychological\\nrelease for excessive emotionalstress. Other circum-\\nstances that may predispose an individual to BED\\ninclude heredity and affective disorders, such as\\nmajor depression. BED patients are also more likely\\nto have a comorbid, or co-existing, diagnosis of impul-\\nsive behaviors (for example, compulsive buying),post-\\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder,o r\\npersonality disorders.\\nIndividuals who develop BED often come from\\nfamilies who put an unnatural emphasis on the\\nimportance of food, for example, as a source of com-\\nfort in times of emotional distress. As children, BED\\npatients may have been taught to clean their plate\\nregardless of their appetite, or that finishing a meal\\nmade them a ‘‘good’’ girl or boy. Cultural attitudes\\ntowards beauty and thinness may also be a factor in\\nthe BED equation.\\nDuring binge episodes, BED patients experience a\\ndefinite sense of lost control over their eating. They eat\\nquickly and to the point of discomfort even if they\\naren’t hungry. They typically binge alone two or more\\ntimes a week, and often feel depressed and guilty once\\nthe episode has concluded.\\nDiagnosis\\nBinge eating disorder is usually diagnosed and\\ntreated by a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist. In\\naddition to an interview with the patient, personality\\nand behavioral inventories, such as theMinnesota\\nMultiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), may be\\nadministered as part of the assessment process. One\\nof several clinical inventories, or scales, may also be\\nused to assess depressive symptoms, including the\\nHamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) or Beck\\nDepression Inventory (BDI). These tests may be admi-\\nnistered in an outpatient or hospital setting.\\nTreatment\\nMany BED individuals binge after long intervals\\nof excessive dietary restraint; therapy helps normalize\\nthis pattern.

The name\\nbiofeedback refers to the biological signals that are\\nfed back, or returned, to the patient in order for the\\npatient to develop techniques of manipulating them.\\nPurpose\\nBiofeedback has been used to successfully treat a\\nnumber of disorders and their symptoms, including\\ntemporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), chronic\\npain, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Raynaud’s\\nsyndrome, epilepsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity\\ndisorder (ADHD), migraine headaches, anxiety,\\ndepression, traumatic brain injury, andsleep disorders.\\nIllnesses that may be triggered at least in part by\\nstress are also targeted by biofeedback therapy. Certain\\ntypes of headaches, high blood pressure,bruxism (teeth\\ngrinding), post-traumatic stress disorder,e a t i n gd i s o r -\\nders, substance abuse, and someanxiety disordersmay\\nbe treated successfully by teaching patients the ability\\nto relax and release both muscle and mental tension.\\nBiofeedback is often just one part of a comprehensive\\ntreatment program for some of these disorders.\\nNASA has used biofeedback techniques to treat\\nastronauts who suffer from severe space sickness, dur-\\ning which the autonomic nervous system is disrupted.\\nScientists at the University of Tennessee have adapted\\nthese techniques to treat individuals suffering from\\nseverenausea and vomiting that is also rooted in\\nautonomic nervous system dysfunction.\\nA patient undergoing biofeedback therapy.

As a result of his experi-\\nments, he showed that such autonomic processes were\\ncontrollable. This work led to the creation of biofeed-\\nback therapy. Willer’s work was expanded by other\\nresearchers. Thereafter, research performed in the\\n1970s by UCLA researcher Dr. Barry Sterman estab-\\nlished that both cats and monkeys could be trained to\\ncontrol their brain wave patterns. Sterman then used\\nhis research techniques on human patients with epi-\\nlepsy, where he was able to reduce seizures by 60%\\nwith the use of biofeedback techniques. Throughout\\nthe 1970s, other researchers published reports of their\\nuse of biofeedback in the treatment of cardiacarrhyth-\\nmias, headaches, Raynaud’s syndrome, and excess\\nstomach acid, and as a tool for teaching deep relaxa-\\ntion. Since the early work of Miller and Sterman,\\nbiofeedback has developed into a front-line behavioral\\ntreatment for an even wider range of disorders and\\nsymptoms.\\nDuring biofeedback, special sensors are placed on\\nthe body. These sensors measure the bodily function\\nthat is causing the patient problem symptoms, such as\\nheart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension (EMG or\\nelectromyographic feedback), brain waves (EEC or elec-\\ntroencophalographic feedback), respiration, and body\\ntemperature (thermal feedback), and translates the\\ninformation into a visual and/or audible readout, such\\nas a paper tracing, a light display, or a series of beeps.\\nWhile the patient views the instantaneous feed-\\nback from the biofeedback monitors, he or she begins\\nto recognize what thoughts, fears, and mental images\\ninfluence his or her physical reactions. By monitor-\\ning this relationship between mind and body, the\\npatient can then use these same thoughts and mental\\nimages as subtle cues, as these act as reminders to\\nbecome deeply relaxed, instead of anxious. These\\nreminders also work to manipulate heart beat, brain\\nwave patterns, body temperature, and other bodily\\nfunctions. This is achieved through relaxation exer-\\ncises, mental imagery, and other cognitive therapy\\ntechniques.\\nAs the biofeedback response takes place, patients\\ncan actually see or hear the results of their efforts\\ninstantly through the sensor readout on the biofeed-\\nback equipment. Once these techniques are learned\\nand the patient is able to recognize the state of relaxa-\\ntion or visualization necessary to alleviate symptoms,\\nthe biofeedback equipment itself is no longer needed.\\nThe patient then has a powerful, portable, and self-\\nadministered treatment tool to deal with problem\\nsymptoms.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAutonomic nervous system— The part of the ner-\\nvous system that controls so-called involuntary\\nfunctions, such as heart rate, salivary gland secre-\\ntion, respiratory function, and pupil dilation.\\nBruxism— Habitual, often unconscious, grinding of\\nthe teeth.\\nEpilepsy— A neurological disorder characterized\\nby the sudden onset of seizures.\\nPlacebo effect— Placebo effect occurs when a treat-\\nment or medication with no known therapeutic\\nvalue (a placebo) is administered to a patient, and\\nthe patient’s symptoms improve.

Research\\nshows that as many as 10 million people might be\\naffected by bipolar disorder, which is the sixth-leading\\ncause of disability worldwide. The average age of\\nonset of bipolar disorder is from adolescence through\\nthe early twenties. However, because of the complexity\\nof the disorder, a correct diagnosis can be delayed for\\nseveral years or more. In a survey of bipolar patients\\nconducted by the National Depressive and Manic\\nDepressive Association (MDMDA), one-half of\\nrespondents reported visiting three or more profes-\\nsionals before receiving a correct diagnosis, and over\\none-third reported a wait of ten years or more before\\nthey were correctly diagnosed.\\nBipolar I disorder is characterized by manic epi-\\nsodes, the ‘‘high’’ of the manic-depressive cycle.

Usually this manic\\nperiod is followed by a period of depression, although\\na few bipolar I individuals may not experience a major\\ndepressive episode. Mixed states, where both manic or\\nhypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms occur\\nat the same time, also occur frequently with bipolar I\\npatients (for example, depression with the racing\\nthoughts of mania). Also, dysphoric mania is common\\n(mania characterized by anger and irritability).\\nBipolar II disorder is characterized by major\\ndepressive episodes alternating with episodes of hypo-\\nmania, a milder form of mania. Bipolar depression\\nmay be difficult to distinguish from a unipolar major\\ndepressive episode. Patients with bipolar depression\\ntend to have extremely low energy, retarded mental\\nand physical processes, and more profoundfatigue\\n(for example, hypersomnia; a sleep disorder marked\\nby a need for excessive sleep or sleepiness when awake)\\nthan unipolar depressives.\\nCyclothymia refers to the cycling of hypomanic\\nepisodes with depression that does not reach major\\ndepressive proportions.

Several studies have uncovered a number of\\npossible genetic connections to the predisposition for\\nbipolar disorder. A 2003 study found thatschizophre-\\nnia and bipolar disorder could have similar genetic\\ncauses that arise from certain problems with genes\\nassociated with myelin development in the central\\nnervous system. (Myelin is a white, fat-like substance\\nthat forms a sort of layer or sheath around nerve\\nfibers.) Another possible biological cause under inves-\\ntigation is the presence of an excessive calcium build-\\nup in the cells of bipolar patients.

If\\nthe mood of the patient is irritable and not elevated,\\nfour of the symptoms are required.\\nAlthough many clinicians find the criteria too\\nrigid, a hypomanic diagnosis requires a duration\\nof at least four days with at least three of the symptoms\\nindicated for manic episodes (four if mood is irritable\\nand not elevated).DSM-IV notes that unlike manic\\nepisodes, hypomanic episodes do not cause a marked\\nimpairment in social or occupational functioning, do\\nnot require hospitalization, and do not have psychotic\\nfeatures. In addition, because hypomanic episodes are\\ncharacterized by high energy and goal directed activ-\\nities and often result in a positive outcome, or are\\nperceived in a positive manner by the patient, bipolar\\nII disorder can go undiagnosed.\\nBipolar symptoms often present differently in\\nchildren and adolescents. Manic episodes in these age\\ngroups are typically characterized by more psychotic\\nfeatures than in adults, which may lead to a misdiag-\\nnosis of schizophrenia. Children and adolescents also\\ntend toward irritability and aggressiveness instead of\\nelation. Further, symptoms tend to be chronic, or\\nongoing, rather than acute, or episodic.

Odle\\nBird flu\\nDefinition\\nBird flu is an infectious disease caused by strains\\nof the Type Ainfluenza viruses that ordinarily only\\ninfect birds. Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infected\\nand caused the deaths of people.\\nDescription\\nBird flu, which is also known as avian influenza,\\nwas first identified in Italy more than 100 years ago.\\nAvian viruses occur naturally in birds, and can infect\\nbirds including chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys,\\npheasants, quail, and guinea fowl. The avian influenza\\nviruses generally do not infect humans.\\nAvian viruses are carried around the world by\\nmigratory birds. Wild ducks are natural reservoirs of\\nthe infection, according to the World Health\\nOrganization (WHO). Those wild birds generally\\ndon’t become ill, but avian flu is extremely contagious\\nand has caused some domesticated birds to become\\nvery ill and die. The casualties included chickens, tur-\\nkeys, and ducks.\\nVirus suptypes\\nReaction to the infection varies among the species\\nbecause flu viruses are constantly mutating into new\\nstrains or subgroups. Low-pathogenic viruses cause\\nfew or no symptoms in infected birds. However,\\nsome strains can mutate into highly pathogenic avian\\ninfluenza (HPAI) strains that are extremely infectious\\nand deadly to birds.\\nThe viruses are identified by a series of letters and\\nnumbers that refer to two proteins, hemagglutinin\\n(HA) and neuraminidase (NA). There are 16 HA sub-\\ntypes and nine NA subtypes of influenza A virus.\\nNumerous combinations of the two proteins are\\npossible, and each combination forms a new subtype.\\nThere are 15 different Influenza A subtypes that\\ncan infect birds, according to the United States\\nCenters for Disease Control (CDC). In comparison,\\nthere are three known subtypes of human flu virus A:\\nH1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. Avian viruses can infect\\npigs, but people are generally not affected. That chan-\\nged when there was an outbreak of H5N1 in Hong\\nKong in 1997.\\nDeadly outbreaks\\nThe highly pathogenic H5N1 virus was first isolated\\nin terns in South Africa in 1961, and then in Hong Kong\\nin 1997. Hong Kong’s avian flu outbreak coincided\\nwith 18 cases of severe respiratory disease in people.\\nThose diagnosed with bird flu had close contact with\\npoultry. Six people died, according to WHO. There\\nwas ‘‘limited transmission’’ of the virus to health care\\nworkers, but they did not become seriously ill.\\nMedical research showed that the avian virus had\\njumped from birds to people. Within three days, Hong\\nKong’s poultry population of about 1.5 million birds\\nwas destroyed to prevent further infection. There was\\nanother H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong in February\\nof 2003. It affected two members of a family that had\\nrecently visited China. One person died, according to\\nthe WHO.\\n542 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBird flu'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 572, 'page_label': '573'}, page_content='In the Netherlands in February of 2003, there was\\nan outbreak of another highly pathogenic avian virus,\\nH7N7. Two months later, a veterinarian died from the\\nvirus. It also caused mild illness in 83 people.\\nIn Hong Kong, the avian virus subtype H9N2\\ncaused mild cases of flu in two children in 1999 and\\none child in the middle of December of 2003, accord-\\ning to WHO. While H9N2 was not highly pathogenic\\nin birds, there was an outbreak of H5N1 in Korea in\\nmid-December of 2003. The next month, there was an\\noutbreak in Vietnam that was followed by outbreaks\\nin other Asian countries.\\nHuman bird flu cases\\nThe World Health Organization tracks bird flu out-\\nbreaks and the charts the numbers of human cases that\\nhave been confirmed by a laboratory. There were 74\\ncases and 49 deaths between January of 2004 and March\\n31, 2005. The flu caused two deaths in Cambodia. In\\nThailand, 12 of 17 people with bird flu died. In Vietnam,\\nthe flu was fatal in 35 of 55 diagnosed cases. Deaths\\nrelated to the H5N1 viruses have been caused bypneu-\\nmonia and pulmonary complications.\\nMoreover, the Democratic People’s Republic of\\nKorea (North Korea) officially reported the country’s\\nfirst outbreak of avian influenza in poultry on March 27,\\n2005. Outbreaks occurred at chicken farms, and there\\nwere no human cases at that time, according to WHO.\\nIn October 2005, an outbreak of bird flu was\\nreported at a farm near the Mongolian capital of\\nHohhot in the People’s Republic of China. The H5N1\\nstrain of the virus was detected in a parrot located in\\nBritain. The parrot contracted the disease while in quar-\\nantine with birds originating in Taiwan. In January 2006,\\nthe H5N1 strain was confirmed as the cause of death in at\\nleast two cases in Dogubeyazit, Turkey. This case, as well\\nas others documented in countries across Europe, indi-\\ncate the potential for the disease to spread worldwide.\\nPreparing for a pandemic\\nThe World Health Organization and nations\\nincluding the United States are troubled about the\\ndeadly consequences that could occur if H5N1 mutated\\ninto a new virus subtype that could be transferred from\\none human to another. That subtype would develop if\\nthe avian virus acquired human influenza genes,\\naccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\\n(USDA). A strain of bird flu spread by human-to-\\nhuman contact could cause an influenza pandemic.\\nA pandemic is a worldwide epidemic that is dan-\\ngerous because people have little or no immunity to\\nthe new virus strain. Historically, pandemics occur\\nthree to four times during a century when new virus\\nsubtypes appear. After World War I, the great influ-\\nenza pandemic of 1917-1918 caused from 40 to 50\\nmillion deaths globally, according to WHO. The flu\\npandemic of 1968-1969 claimed 1 to 4 million lives.\\nAccording to a 2004 WHO report, medical influ-\\nenza experts agree that another flu pandemic is ‘‘inevi-\\ntable and possibly imminent.’’ In a December 8, 2004\\nreport, WHO warned that the ‘‘best case scenario’’\\nprojection for next pandemic was that the new flu strain\\nwould kill from 2 to 7 million people. Moreover, ‘‘tens\\nof millions’’ of people would require medical attention.\\nThe appearance of H5N1 signals that the world is\\nmoving closer to a pandemic, WHO reported.\\nThe spread of H5N1 to humans increased the\\nlikelihood of a new strain emerging that could be\\ntransmitted by people. That could create a pandemic.\\nNations and the World Health Organization are\\nworking to prevent a pandemic or cause it to be less\\ndeadly. Their strategies include efforts to decrease the\\nspread of flu strains in poultry and the development of\\nvaccines to treat the virus in people.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAvian flu is caused by an influenza virus that birds\\ncarry in their intestines. The virus spreads as infected\\nbirds excrete saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. Birds\\nvulnerable to the flu become infected when they come\\ninto contact with the excretions or surfaces contami-\\nnated by the infected matter.\\nBirds that survive the H5N1 infection can\\nexcrete the virus for at least 10 days, according to a\\nWHO report. The strain had proliferated through\\nbird-to-bird contact to flocks on farms and poultry\\nin live bird markets. The virus can also spread in\\nsurfaces including manure, bird feed, equipment,\\nvehicles, egg flats, and crates, and the clothing and\\nshoes of people who came into contact with the\\nvirus.\\nA small amount of a highly pathogenic avian\\ninfluenza virus could be deadly. One gram (0.035\\nounces) of contaminated manure could hold enough\\nvirus to infect 1 million birds, according to the USDA.\\nFrom 1997 through the spring of 2005, the viruses\\nprimarily infected people in Asia who had contact\\nwith infected birds and surfaces.\\nBird flu symptoms in people\\nIn early 2005, information about symptoms of\\nH5N1 in humans was based on the 1997 Hong Kong\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 543\\nBird flu'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 573, 'page_label': '574'}, page_content='outbreak. People experienced traditional flu symptoms\\nsuch as afever, cough, sore throat, and aching muscles.\\nOther symptoms included eye infections (conjunctivi-\\ntis), pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, viral pneu-\\nmonia, and other severe and life-threatening\\ncomplications.\\nAvian flu symptoms in birds\\nThe sudden death of a bird that had not appeared\\nill is one symptom of the highly pathogenic bird flu.\\nAccording to the USDA, infected live birds may dis-\\nplay one or more of the following symptoms: lack\\nof energy, appetite loss, nasal discharge, coughing,\\nsneezing, a lack of coordination, anddiarrhea.I n\\naddition, the bird may lay fewer eggs or produce eggs\\nthat are soft-shelled or misshapen. Furthermore, there\\nmay be swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, and wat-\\ntles. Another symptom is purple discoloration on the\\ncombs, wattles, and legs.\\nIf there is an outbreak of the highly pathogenic\\nflu in birds, they are destroyed to prevent the spread of\\nthe virus.\\nVirus mixing vessels\\nInfluenza viruses undergo frequent changes and\\nform new subtypes. In addition, influenza A viruses\\ncan trade genetic materials with the viruses of other\\nspecies. Two different strains trade or merge material,\\na process known as an antigenic shift. That shift pro-\\nduces a new subtype that is different from the two\\nparent viruses. When the new subtype contains genes\\nfrom the human virus, a pandemic resulted because\\nthere was no immunity to the virus and no vaccine to\\nprotect against it.\\nThe genetic shift occurs in a ‘‘mixing vessel’’ that\\nwas susceptible to both types of flu. In the past, the\\nshift was thought to be related to people living close to\\npigs and domestic poultry. Pigs can be infected by\\navian viruses and mammalian viruses like the human\\nstrains, according to WHO. However, research into\\nthe H5N1 strain indicates that people can serve as the\\nmixing vessels. As more people become infected with\\nbird flu, the probability increases that humans would\\nserve as the mixing vessel for a new subtype that could\\nbe transmitted from one person to another.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe symptoms of avian flu and human flu are very\\nsimilar, so laboratory testing is needed to diagnose\\navian influenza. In addition to diagnosing the indivi-\\ndual, testing in 2005 was performed to determine\\nwhether the infection was spreading from birds to\\npeople or from humans to humans.\\nDiagnostic tests for human flu are rapid and reli-\\nable, according to WHO. The international organiza-\\ntion noted that laboratories within WHO’s global\\nnetwork have high-security facilities and experienced\\nstaff. Test methods include a viral culture that ana-\\nlyses a blood sample and swabbings of the nose or\\nthroat. Other testing examines respiratory secretions.\\nIn the United States, the Centers for Disease\\nControl is among the organizations preparing for a\\npossible outbreak of bird flu in humans. In addition to\\nspecifics related to diagnosing bird flu, CDC refers\\nhealthcare workers to precautions to prevent the\\nspread of flu and other respiratory infections in med-\\nical settings.\\nPrecautionary measures include directing people\\nto observe cough etiquette. People with symptoms of\\nrespiratory infection should cover their mouths or use\\nfacial tissues when coughing or sneezing. After cough-\\ning or sneezing, the person should wash their hands\\nwith a non-antimicrobial soap and water, alcohol-\\nbased hand rub, or antiseptic handwash.\\nFurthermore, people with flu-like symptoms may\\nbe given masks to wear while they are waiting to be\\nexamined by medical personnel. The healthcare work-\\ners should wear masks in some circumstances.\\nUndoubtedly, they will wear masks when working\\nwith people with symptoms of bird flu.\\nTreatment\\nAs of March of 2005, there was no vaccine to\\nprotect people from the H5N1 virus, according to the\\nCDC. However, the U.S. agency and the World\\nHealth Organization had isolated seed strains of the\\nvirus in order to make a vaccine. Safety tests were\\nscheduled to start in April of 2005 on a vaccine man-\\nufactured by Sanofi pasteur, a firm in Swiftwater,\\nPennsylvania, formerly known as Aventis Pasteur.\\nOn March 23, 2005, the National Institute of\\nAllergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced\\nthat fast-track recruitment had started for volunteers\\nto participate in an investigative study of the vaccine.\\nDuring the Phase I trial, the trial vaccine will be tested\\non 450 healthy adults between the ages of 18 to 64,\\naccording to NIAID, which is part of the National\\nInstitutes of Health.\\nStudies were to be conducted at University of\\nCalifornia at Los Angeles, University of Maryland\\nSchool of Medicine in Baltimore, and the University\\nof Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry,\\n544 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBird flu'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 574, 'page_label': '575'}, page_content='Rochester, New York. If the vaccine is proven safe for\\nadults, there were plans to test it in people in other age\\ngroups such as children and the elderly.\\nFurthermore, research was underway on a vaccine\\nto fight H9N2, another avian flu virus subtype.\\nTreatment with existing drugs\\nExisting anti-viral medications may sometimes be\\neffective against avian flu viruses, according to a\\nMarch 18, 2005, report from CDC. In the United\\nStates, four drugs have been approved by the U.S.\\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treat-\\nment and prevention of influenza A viruses.\\nThe medications amantadine (Symmetrel),\\nrimantadine (Flumadine), seltamivir (Tamiflu), and\\nzanamivir (Relenza) were clinically effective in the\\ntreatment of influenza A viruses in otherwise healthy\\nadults.\\nHowever, avian flu research indicated that the\\nH5N1 virus was resistant to amantadine and rimanta-\\ndine, according to CCDC. The other two drugs would\\n‘‘probably work,’’ according to CDC. However, stu-\\ndies were needed of the medication’s effectiveness.\\nDuring the 2004 human flu season in the United\\nStates, the Associated Press reported that Relenza cost\\nabout $55 for the typical 10-day treatment. Tamiflu\\ncost approximately $66 for the same course of treat-\\nment. Insurance frequently covered part of the pre-\\nscription costs.\\nFor people diagnosed with bird flu, the World\\nHealth Organization recommends that patients take\\nTamiflu twice daily for five days. Treatment should\\nbegin as soon as possible. Patients may also receive\\nmedication to lower fevers andantibiotics to fight\\nsecondary infections.\\nIn the spring of 2005, there was no H5N1 vaccine.\\nCountries including the United States were reportedly\\nstockpiling Tamiflu in the event a pandemic erupted.\\nAt that time, WHO and CDC recommended the issu-\\ning of anti-viral medication as a preventive measure to\\npeople working in poultry production. Those people,\\nalong with health care workers, would have priority\\nfor the medications.\\nAlternative treatment\\nIn March of 2005, people in South Korea began\\neating more kimchi to ward off avian flu infection,\\naccording to the reports from the British Broadcasting\\nCompany and other news organizations. The public\\nturned to the spicy vegetable dish after scientists at\\nSeoul National University announced that kimchi\\naided in the recovery of 11 out of 13 infected chickens.\\nThe scientists fed the birds an extract of kimchi, a dish\\nmade by fermenting cabbage with red peppers,\\nradishes, and large amounts of garlic and ginger. A\\nweek later, all but two birds showed signs of recovery.\\nThe researchers acknowledged that their study\\nwas unscientific. At that time, they were not sure\\nhow or why kimchi was related to the recovery.\\nHowever, the announcement led people to again\\nregard kimchi as a health remedy. In 2003, interest in\\nkimchi increased when people thought eating it helped\\npreventSARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).\\nNo scientific confirmation was made between kimchi\\nand SARS prevention.\\nPrognosis\\nBird flu has been fatal to people, and there was\\nconcern in 2005 about the virus mutating into a strain\\nthat could be transmittedby people. Health organi-\\nzations and government agencies focused on pre-\\nventing or reducing the risks of a pandemic caused\\nby bird flu.\\nIn the United States, research was underway on\\nvaccines to fight the flu. Other efforts include the\\nUSDA Safety’s guidelines for people working with\\npoultry. Strategies included trade restrictions on poul-\\ntry and poultry products from Asia, according to the\\nUSDA. Imported live birds and eggs were quarantined\\nfor 30 days. During that time, they were tested for bird\\nflu and exotic Newcastle disease. The United States\\nbans the import of poultry meat from Asia because\\nmeat processing plants were not approved by the\\nUSDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service.\\nPrevention\\nIn the spring of 2005, bird flu was primarily a risk\\nfor people in the United States who worked with\\npoultry. Potentially vulnerable people included those\\nworking with poultry on farms and avian health work-\\ners like veterinarians. People working with birds in\\nlocations such as commercial poultry facilities, veter-\\ninary offices, and live bird markets should wear pro-\\ntective clothing. That equipment includes boots,\\ncoveralls, face masks, gloves, and headgear, according\\nto the USDA. If necessary, they should receive anti-\\nviral medications as a safeguard.\\nFurthermore, poultry producers should imple-\\nment security measures to prevent the outbreak of a\\nhighly pathogenic virus.

Minor defects are\\nabnormalities that do not cause serious health or social\\nproblems. When multiple birth defects occur together\\nand have a similar cause, they are called syndromes. If\\ntwo or more defects tend to appear together but do not\\nshare the same cause, they are called associations.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe specific cause of many congenital abnormal-\\nities is unknown, but several factors associated with\\npregnancyand delivery can increase the risk of birth\\ndefects.\\nTeratogens\\nAny substance that can cause abnormal develop-\\nment of the egg in the mother’s womb is called a\\nteratogen. In the first two months after conception,\\nthe developing organism is called an embryo; develop-\\nmental stages from two months to birth are called\\nfetal. Growth is rapid, and each body organ has a\\ncritical period in which it is especially sensitive to out-\\nside influences. About 7% of all congenital defects are\\ncaused by exposure to teratogens.\\nDRUGS. Only a few drugs are known to cause birth\\ndefects, but all have the potential to cause harm.\\nFor example, in 2003, a study found that use of topical\\n(local)corticosteroidsin the first trimester of pregnancy\\nmay be associated withcleft lip. Thalidomide is known\\nto cause defects of the arms and legs; several other\\ntypes also cause problems.\\n/C15Alcohol.

An abnormal\\namount of amniotic fluid may indicate or cause birth\\ndefects. Amniotic fluid is the liquid that surrounds and\\nprotects the unborn child in the uterus. Too little of this\\nfluid can interfere with lung or limb development. Too\\nmuch amniotic fluid can accumulate if the fetus has a\\ndisorder that interferes with swallowing. In 2003, a\\nstudy linked the mother’s weight to risk of birth defects.\\nObese women were about three times more likely to\\nhave an infant with spina bifida or omphalocele\\n(protrusion of part of the intestine through the abdom-\\ninal wall) than women of average weight.

Found at\\nbirth (congenital) or developing later in life (acquired)\\nanywhere on the body, they range from faint spots to\\ndark swellings covering wide areas.\\nDescription\\nSkin angiomas, also called vascular (pertaining to\\nvessel) nevi (marks), are composed of blood vessels\\n(hemangiomas) or lymph vessels (lymphangiomas),\\nthat lie beneath the skin’s surface. Hemangiomas,\\ncomposed of clusters of cells that line the capillaries,\\nthe body’s smallest blood vessels, are found on the face\\nand neck (60%), trunk (25%), or the arms and legs\\n(15%). Congenital hemangiomas, 90% of which\\nappear at birth or within the first month of life, grow\\nquickly, and disappear over time. They are found in 1-\\n10% of full-term infants, and 25% of premature\\ninfants. About 65% are capillary hemangiomas\\n(strawberry marks), 15% are cavernous (deep) heman-\\ngiomas, and the rest are mixtures. Hemangiomas are\\nthree times more common in girls. Usually, only one\\nhemangioma is found, in 20% two are found, while\\nfewer than 5% have three or more.

Found around the eyes, cheek-\\nbones, arms, and legs, spider angiomas are red marks\\nformed from dilated blood vessels. They occur during\\npregnancyin 70% of white women and 10% of black\\nwomen, in alcoholics andliver diseasepatients, and in\\n50% of children. Cherry angiomas, dilated capillaries\\nfound mainly on the trunk, appear in the 30s, and\\nmultiply withaging.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are no known causes for congenital skin\\nangiomas; they may be related to an inherited weak-\\nness of vessel walls. Exposure to estrogen causes spider\\nangiomas in pregnant women or those takingoral\\ncontraceptives. Spider angiomas tend to run in\\nfamilies, and may be associated with liver disease,\\nsun exposure, and trauma.\\nHemangiomas\\nHemangiomas first appear as single or multiple,\\nwhite or pale pink marks, ranging from 2-20 cm (aver-\\nage 2-5 cm) in size. Some are symptomless while others\\ncausepain or bleeding, or interfere with normal func-\\ntioning when they are numerous, enlarged, infected, or\\nulcerated.

The doctor takes a complete medical\\nhistory and performs aphysical examinationincluding\\ninspection and palpation of the marks. The skin is\\nexamined for discoloration, scarring, bleeding, infec-\\ntion, or ulceration. The type, location, size, number,\\nand severity of the marks are recorded. The doctor may\\nempty the mark of blood by gentle pressure. Biopsies or\\nspecialized x rays or scans of the abnormal vessels and\\ntheir surrounding areas may be performed. Patients\\nwith port-wine stains near the eye may requireskull x\\nrays, computed tomography scans, and vision and\\ncentral nervous system tests. Most insurance plans\\npay for diagnosis and treatment of these conditions.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment choices for skin angiomas and vascular\\nmalformations depend on their type, location, and\\nseverity, and whether they cause symptoms, pain, or\\ndisfigurement.\\nWatchful waiting\\nNo treatment is given, but the mark is regularly\\nexamined. This continues until the mark disappears,\\nor requires treatment. This approach is particularly\\nappropriate for the treatment of hemangiomas,\\nwhich often do not require treatment, since they even-\\ntually shrink by themselves.\\nDrugs\\nCORTICOSTEROIDS. Daily doses of the anti-\\ninflammatory drugs prednisone or prednisolone are\\ngiven for up to 2 months with gradual reduction of\\nthe dose. The marks begin to subside within 7-10 days,\\nbut may take up to 2 months to fully disappear. If no\\nresponse is seen in 2 weeks, the drug is discontinued.\\nTreatment may be repeated. Side effects include growth\\nretardation, increased blood pressure and blood sugar,\\ncataracts, glandular disorders, and infection. Thecor-\\nticosteroids triamcinolone acetate and betamethasone\\nsodium phosphate or acetate are injected directly into\\nthe marks with a response usually achieved within a\\nweek; additional injections are given in 4-6 weeks. Side\\neffects include tissue damage at the injection site.\\nINTERFERON ALPHA-2A. This drug reduces cell\\ngrowth, and is used for vascular marks that affect\\nvision, and that are unresponsive to corticosteroids.\\nGiven in daily injections under the skin, a response\\nrate of 50% is achieved after about 7 months. Side\\neffects includefever, chills, muscle and joint pain,\\nvision disorders, low white and red blood cell counts,\\nfatigue, elevated liver enzymes,nausea, blood clotting\\nproblems, and nerve damage.\\nANTIBIOTICS. Oral or topical (applied to the skin)\\nantibiotics are prescribed for infected marks.\\nSurgery\\nLASER SURGERY. Lasers create intense heat that\\ndestroys abnormal blood vessels beneath the skin,\\nwithout damaging normal skin. Two types of lasers\\nare used: the flashlamp-pulsed dye laser (FPDL) and\\nthe neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser. The FPDL,\\nused mainly for strawberry marks and port-wine\\nstains, penetrates to a depth of 1.8 mm and causes\\nlittle scarring, while the Nd:YAG laser penetrates to\\na depth of 6 mm, and is used to treat deep hemangio-\\nmas. Laser surgeryis not usually painful, but can be\\nuncomfortable. Anesthetic cream is used for FPDL\\ntreatment. Treatment with the Nd:YAG laser requires\\nlocal orgeneral anesthesia . Children are usually\\nsedated or anesthetized. Healing occurs within 2\\nweeks. Side effects include bruising, skin discolora-\\ntion, swelling, crusting, and minor bleeding.\\nSURGICAL EXCISION.

In the United States, where the dog popula-\\ntion exceeds 50 million, dogs surpass all other mammals\\nin the number of bites inflicted on humans. However,\\nmost dog-bite injuries are minor. A telephone survey of\\nU.S. households conducted in1994 led researchers to\\nestimate that 3,737,000 dogbites not requiring medical\\nattention occurred in the United States that year, versus\\n757,000 that required medical treatment. Studies also\\nshow that most dog bites are from pets or other dogs\\nknown to the bitten person, that males are more likely\\nthan females to be bitten, and that children face a greater\\nrisk than adults. Each year, about 10-20 Americans,\\nmostly children under 10 years of age, are killed by dogs.\\nDog bites result in an estimated 340,000 emergency\\nroom visits annually throughout the United States.\\nMore than half of the bites seen by emergency depart-\\nments occur at home. Children under 10 years old,\\nespecially boys between 5 and 9 years of age, are more\\nlikely than older people to visit an emergency room for\\nbite treatment. Children under 10 years old were also\\nmuch more liable to be bitten on the face, neck, and\\nhead. Nearly all of the injuries suffered by people seek-\\ning treatment in emergency rooms were of ‘‘low sever-\\nity,’’ and most were treated and released without being\\nadmitted to the hospital or sent to another facility.\\nMany of the bites resulted from people attempting to\\nbreak up fights between animals.\\nCATS. Although cats are found in nearly a third of\\nU.S. households, cat bites are far less common than\\ndog bites. According to one study, cats inflict perhaps\\n400,000 harmful bites in the United States each year.\\nThe tissue damage caused by cat bites is usually lim-\\nited, but they carry a high risk of infection. Whereas\\nthe infection rate for dog bite injuries is 15-20%, the\\ninfection rate for cat bites is 30-40%.\\nHUMANS. Bites from mammals other than dogs\\nand cats are uncommon, with one exception—human\\nbites. There are approximately 70,000 human bites\\neach year in the United States. Because the human\\nmouth contains a multitude of potentially harmful\\nmicroorganisms, human bites are more infectious\\nthan those of most other animals.\\nArthropods\\nArthropods are invertebrates belonging to the phy-\\nlum Arthropoda, which includes insects, arachnids,\\ncrustaceans, and other subgroups. There are more than\\n700,000 species in all. The list of arthropods that bite or\\nstinghumansisextensiveandincludeslice,bedbugs,fleas,\\nmosquitoes, black flies, ants, chiggers, ticks, centipedes,\\nscorpions, and other species.Spiders, bees, and wasps are\\nthe three kinds of arthropod that most often bite people.\\nSPIDERS. In the United States, only two kinds of\\nvenomous spider are truly dangerous: widow spiders\\nand brown (violin or fiddle) spiders. The black widow,\\nwhich is found in every state but Alaska, is probably\\nthe most notorious widow spider. It prefers dark, dry\\nplaces such as barns, garages, and outhouses, and also\\nlives under rocks and logs. Disturbing a female black\\nwidow or its web may provoke a bite. Brown spiders\\nalso prefer sheltered places, including clothing, and\\nmay bite if disturbed.\\nBEES AND WASPS. Bees and wasps will sting\\nto defend their nests or if they are disturbed.

More than 50 Americans\\ndie each year after being stung by a bee, wasp, or ant.\\nAlmost all of those deaths are the result of allergic\\nreactions, and not of exposure to the venom itself.\\nSnakes\\nThere are 20 species of venomous snakes in the\\nUnited States. These snakes are found in every state\\nexcept Maine, Alaska, and Hawaii. Each year about\\n8,000 Americans receive a venomous snakebite, but no\\nmore than about 15 die, mostly from rattlesnake bites.\\nThe venomous snakes of the United States are\\ndivided into two families, the Crotalidae (pit vipers)\\nand the Elapidae. Pit vipers, named after the small\\nheat-sensing pit that lies between each eye and nostril,\\nare responsible for about 99% of the venomous snake-\\nbites suffered by Americans. Rattlesnakes, copperheads,\\nand cottonmouths (also called water moccasins) are pit\\nvipers. This family of snakes delivers its venom through\\ntwo long, hinged fangs in the upper jaw. Some pit vipers\\ncarry a potent venom that can threaten the brain and\\nspinal cord. The venom of others, such as the copper-\\nheads, is less harmful.\\nThe Elapidae family includes two kinds of veno-\\nmous coral snakes indigenous to the southern and\\nwestern states. Because coral snakes are bashful crea-\\ntures that come out only at night, they almost never\\nbite humans, and are responsible for approximately 25\\nbites a year in the United States. Coral snakes also\\nhave short fangs and a small mouth, which lowers the\\nrisk of a bite actually forcing venom into a person’s\\nbody.

Also, dogs trained to attack may\\nbite repeatedly during a single episode. Infected bites\\nusually causepain, cellulitis (inflammation of the con-\\nnective tissues), and a pus-filled discharge at the\\nwound site within 8-24 hours. Most infections are\\nconfined to the wound site, but many of the micro-\\norganisms in the mouths of dogs can cause systemic\\nand possibly life-threatening infections.

As a rule, people rarely see a black\\nwidow bite, nor do they feel the bite as it occurs. The\\nfirst (and possibly only) evidence that a person has\\nbeen bitten may be a mild swelling of the injured area\\nand two red puncture marks. Within a short time,\\nhowever, some victims begin to experience severemus-\\ncle cramps and rigidity of the abdominal muscles.\\nOther possible symptoms include excessive sweating,\\nnausea, vomiting, headaches, and vertigo as well as\\nbreathing, vision, and speech problems.\\nA brown spider’s bite can lead to necrotic ara-\\nchnidism, in which the tissue in an area of up to several\\ninches around the bite becomes necrotic (dies), produ-\\ncing an open sore that can take months or years to\\ndisappear. In most cases, however, the bite simply\\nproduces a hard, painful, itchy, and discolored area\\nthat heals without treatment in 2-3 days. The bite may\\nalso be accompanied by a fever, chills, edema (an\\naccumulation of excess tissue fluid),nausea and vomit-\\ning, dizziness, muscle and joint pain, and a rash.\\nBEES AND WASPS. The familiar symptoms of bee\\nand wasp stings include pain, redness, swelling, and\\nitchiness in the area of the sting.

Jellyfish venom is delivered by barbs\\ncalled nematocysts, which are located on the crea-\\nture’s tentacles and penetrate the skin of people who\\nbrush up against them. Instantly painful and itchy\\nred lesions usually result. The pain can continue up\\nto 48 hours. Severe cases may lead to skin necrosis,\\nmuscle spasms and cramps, vomiting, nausea, diar-\\nrhea, headaches, excessive sweating, and other symp-\\ntoms.

Deep puncture wounds result\\nthat can cause an infection if pieces of spine become\\nembedded in the wound. A typical stingray injury\\nscenario involves a person who inadvertently steps\\non a resting stingray and is lashed in the ankle by its\\ntail.

A person’s general health must also be\\nassessed, including the tetanus immunization history\\nif any, as well as information concerning possible\\nallergiesto medication and pre-existing health pro-\\nblems that may increase the risk of infection.\\nA physical examinationrequires careful scrutiny of\\nthe wound, with special attention to possible bone,\\njoint, ligament, muscle, tendon, nerve, or blood-vessel\\ndamage caused by deep punctures or severe crush inju-\\nries. Serious hand injuries should be evaluated by a\\nspecialized surgeon. Most of the time, laboratory tests\\nfor identifying the microorganisms in bite wounds are\\nperformed if infection is present. X rays and other\\ndiagnostic procedures may also be necessary.\\nCATS. The diagnostic procedures used for dog\\nbites also apply to cat bites.\\nHUMANS. Testing the blood of a person who has\\nbeen bitten for immunity to hepatitis B and other\\ndiseases is always necessary after a human bite.\\nIdeally, the biter should be tested as well for the pre-\\nsence of transmissible disease. Clenched-fist injuries\\noften require evaluation by a hand surgeon or orthope-\\ndist. Because many people will deny having been in a\\nfight, medical professionals usually consider lacerations\\nover the fourth and fifth knuckles—the typical result of\\na clenched-fist injury—to be evidence of a bite wound.\\nMedical professionals also look for indications of\\nspousal or childabuse when evaluating human bites.\\nArthropods\\nSPIDERS. Because bites from widow spiders and\\nbrown spiders require different treatments, capturing\\nand identifying the spider helps to establish diagnosis.\\nSnakes\\nDiagnosis relies on a physical examination of the\\nvictim, information about the circumstances of the\\nbite, and a look at the snake itself (if it can safely be\\nkilled and brought in for identification). Blood tests\\nandurinalysis supply important data on the victim’s\\ncondition. Chest x-rays and electrocardiography (a\\nprocedure for measuring heart activity) may also be\\nnecessary.\\nTreatment\\nMammals\\nDOGS. Minor dog bites can be treated at home. The\\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians recommends\\ngently washing the wound with soap and water and then\\napplying pressure to the injured area with a clean towel\\nto stop the bleeding. The next step is to apply anti-\\nbiotic ointment and a sterile bandage to the wound.\\nTo reduce swelling and fend off infection, ice should\\nbe applied and the injured area kept elevated above\\nthe level of the heart. The wound should be cleaned\\nand covered with ointment twice a day until it heals.\\nAny dog bite that does not stop bleeding after\\n15 minutes of pressure must be seen by a medical\\nprofessional. The same is true for bites that are deep\\nor gaping; for bites to the head, hands, or feet; and for\\nbites that may have broken a bone, damaged nerves,\\nor caused a major injury of another kind.

Such bites are usually treated with\\nantibiotics and left open because of the high risk of\\ninfection. A study released in June 2004 showed that\\nroutine use of antibiotics for human bites may not be\\nnecessary, as physicians try to minimize overuse of\\nantibiotics. Superficial wounds in low-risk areas may\\nno longer need antibiotic treatment, but more serious\\nhuman bites to high-risk areas such as the hands\\nshould be treated with antibiotics to prevent serious\\ninfection. A person who has been bitten may also\\nrequire immunization against hepatitis B and other\\ndiseases. Persons who are being treated for a\\nclenched-fist injury will require a daily follow-up\\nexamination for 3-5 days.\\nArthropods\\nSPIDERS. No spider bite should be ignored.\\nThe antidote for severe widow spider bites is a sub-\\nstance called antivenin, which contains antibodies\\ntaken from the blood serum of horses injected with\\nspider venom.

The drug\\ndapsone, used to treatleprosy, can sometimes stop the\\ntissue death associated with a brown spider bite.\\nNecrotic areas may need debridement (removal of\\ndead and damaged tissue) and skin grafts. Pain medica-\\ntions,antihistamines, antibiotics, and tetanus shots are\\na few of the other treatments that are sometimes neces-\\nsary after a bite from a brown spider or widow spider.\\nBEES AND WASPS. Most stings can be treated at\\nhome. A stinger that is stuck in the skin can be scraped\\noff with a blade, fingernail, credit card, or piece of\\npaper (using tweezers may push more venom out of\\nthe venom sac and into the wound). The area should\\nbe cleaned and covered with an ice pack.Aspirin and\\nother pain medications, oral antihistamines, and cala-\\nmine lotion are good for treating minor symptoms.\\nPutting meat tenderizer on the wound has no effect.\\nPersons who have been stung and experience an\\nallergic reaction, or who are at risk due to their medical\\nhistory, require immediate medical attention. The danger\\nsigns, which usually begin 10 minutes after an individual\\nis stung (though possibly not for several hours), include\\nnausea, faintness, chest pain, abdominal cramps,\\ndiarrhea, and difficulty swallowing or breathing.\\nSnakes\\nAlthough most snakes are not venomous, any sna-\\nkebite should immediately be examined at a hospital.\\nWhile waiting for emergency help to arrive, the victim\\nshould wash the wound site with soap and water, and\\nthen keep the injured area still and at a level lower than\\nthe heart. Ice should never be used on the wound site\\nnor should attempts be made to suck out the venom.\\nMaking a cut at the wound site is also dangerous. It is\\nimportant to stay calm and wait for emergency medical\\naid if it can arrive quickly. Otherwise, the victim should\\nproceed directly to a hospital.\\nWhen the victim arrives at a hospital, the medical\\nstaff must determine whether the bite was inflicted by\\na venomous snake and, if so, whether envenomation\\noccurred and how much venom the person has\\nreceived.

Although people\\nwho live in cities often have some black deposits in\\ntheir lungs from polluted air, coal miners have much\\nmore extensive deposits.\\nIn the years since the federal government has\\nregulated dust levels in coal mines, the number of\\ncases of black lung disease has fallen sharply. Since\\nthe Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969,\\naverage dust levels have fallen from 8.0 mg. per cubic\\nmeter to the current standard of 2.0 mg. per cubic\\nmeter. The 1969 law also set up a black lung disability\\nbenefits program to compensate coal miners who have\\nbeen disabled by on-the-job dust exposure.\\nDespite the technology available to control the\\nhazard, however, miners still run the risk of develop-\\ning this lung disease. The risk is much lower today,\\nhowever; fewer than 10% of coal miners have any x\\nray evidence of coal dust deposits. When there is such\\nevidence, it often shows up as only small black spots\\nless than 0.4 in (1 cm). in diameter, and may have been\\ncaused bysmoking rather than coal dust. This condi-\\ntion is called ‘‘simple CWP’’ and does not lead to\\nsymptoms or disability.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSince the particles of fine coal dust, which a miner\\nbreathes when he is in the mines, cannot be destroyed\\nwithin the lungs or removed from them, builds up.\\nEventually, this build-up causes thickening and\\nscarring, making the lungs less efficient in supplying\\noxygen to the blood.\\nThe primary symptom of the disease isshortness\\nof breath, which gradually gets worse as the disease\\nprogresses. In severe cases, the patient may develop\\ncor pulmonale, an enlargement and strain of the right\\nside of the heart caused by chronic lung disease. This\\nmay eventually cause right-sidedheart failure.\\nSome patients developemphysema (a disease in\\nwhich the tiny air sacs in the lungs become damaged,\\nleading to shortness of breath, and respiratory and\\nheart failure) as a complication of black lung disease.\\nOthers develop a severe type of black lung disease\\ncalled progressive massive fibrosis, in which damage\\ncontinues in the upper parts of the lungs even after\\nexposure to the dust has ended. Scientists aren’t sure\\nwhat causes this serious complication. Some think\\nthat it may be due to the breathing of a mixture of\\ncoal and silica dust that is found in certain mines.\\nSilica is far more likely to lead to scarring than coal\\ndust alone.\\nDiagnosis\\nBlack lung disease can be diagnosed by checking a\\npatient’s history for exposure to coal dust, followed by\\na chest x-ray to discover if the characteristic spots in\\nthe lungs caused by coal dust are present.

Turkington\\nBladder calculi see Bladder stones\\nBladder cancer\\nDefinition\\nBladder cancer is a disease in which the cells lining\\nthe urinary bladder lose the ability to regulate their\\ngrowth and start dividing uncontrollably. This abnor-\\nmal growth results in a mass of cells that form a tumor.\\nDescription\\nBladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer\\nin the United States. The American Cancer Society\\n(ACS) estimated that in 2001, approximately 54,300\\nnew cases of bladder cancer would be diagnosed\\n(about 39,200 men and 15,100 women), causing\\napproximately 12,400 deaths. The rates for men of\\nAfrican descent and Hispanic men are similar and\\nare approximately one-half of the rate among white\\nnon-Hispanic men. The lowest rate of bladder cancer\\noccurs in the Asian population. Among women, the\\nhighest rates also occur in white non-Hispanic females\\nand are approximately twice the rate for Hispanics.\\nWomen of African descent have higher rates of blad-\\nder cancer than Hispanic women.\\nThe urinary bladder is a hollow muscular organ\\nthat stores urine from the kidneys until it is excreted out\\nof the body. Two tubes called the ureters bring the urine\\nfrom the kidneys to the bladder. The urethra carries\\nthe urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.\\nBladder cancer has a very high rate of recurrence.\\nEven after superficial tumors are completely removed,\\nthere is a 75% chance that new tumors will develop\\nin other areas of the bladder. Hence, patients need\\nfrequent and thorough follow-up care.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAlthough the exact cause of bladder cancer is not\\nknown, smokers are twice as likely as nonsmokers to get\\nthe disease. Hence,smoking is considered the greatest\\nrisk factor for bladder cancer. Workers who are exposed\\nto certain chemicals used in the dye industry and in the\\nrubber, leather, textile, and paint industries are believed\\nto be at a higher risk for bladder cancer. The disease also\\nis three times more common in men than in women;\\ncaucasians also are at an increased risk. The risk of\\nbladder cancer increases with age. Most cases are\\nfound in people who are 50–70 years old. In 2003, studies\\nshowed that hormone replacement therapy(HRT), a\\ntreatment used by many postmenopausal women, sig-\\nnificantly increased the risk of bladder and other cancers.\\nFrequent urinary infections, kidney andbladder\\nstones, and other conditions that cause long-term\\nirritation to the bladder may increase the risk of getting\\nbladder cancer. A past history of tumors in the bladder\\nalso could increase one’s risk of getting other tumors.\\nOne of the first warning signals of bladder cancer is\\nblood in the urine. Sometimes, there is enough blood to\\nchange the color of the urine to a yellow-red or a dark\\nred. At other times, the color of the urine appears\\nnormal but chemical testing of the urine reveals the\\npresence of blood cells. A change in bladder habits\\nsuch as painful urination, increased frequency of\\nurination and a feeling of needing to urinate but not\\nbeing able to do so are some of the signs of possible\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 563\\nBladder cancer'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 593, 'page_label': '594'}, page_content='bladder cancer. All of these symptoms also may be\\ncaused by conditions other than cancer, but it is impor-\\ntant to see a doctor and have the symptoms evaluated.\\nWhen detected early and treated appropriately, patients\\nhave a very good chance of being cured completely.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf a doctor has any reason to suspect bladder can-\\ncer, several tests can help find out if the disease is\\npresent. As a first step, a complete medical history\\nwill be taken to check for any risk factors. A thorough\\nphysical examinationwill be conducted to assess all the\\nsigns and symptoms. Laboratory testing of a urine\\nsample will help to rule out the presence of a bacterial\\ninfection. In a urine cytology test, the urine is examined\\nunder a microscope to look for any abnormal or can-\\ncerous cells. A catheter (tube) can be advanced into\\nthe bladder through the urethra, and a salt solution is\\npassed through it to wash the bladder. The solution\\ncan then be collected and examined under a microscope\\nto check for the presence of cancerous cells.\\nA test known as the intravenous pyelogram (IVP)\\nis an x–ray examination that is done after a dye is\\ninjected into the blood stream through a vein in the\\narm. The dye travels through the blood stream and\\nthen reaches the kidneys to be excreted. It clearly out-\\nlines the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra.\\nMultiple x rays are taken to detect any abnormality\\nin the lining of these organs.\\nThe physician may use a procedure known as a\\ncystoscopy to view the inside of the bladder. A thin\\nhollow lighted tube is introduced into the bladder\\nthrough the urethra. If any suspicious looking masses\\nare seen, a small piece of the tissue can be removed\\nfrom it using a pair of biopsy forceps. The tissue is then\\nexamined microscopically to verify if cancer is present,\\nand if so, to identify the type of cancer.\\nIf cancer is detected and there is evidence to indi-\\ncate that it has metastasized (spread) to distant sites in\\nthe body, imaging tests such as chest x rays, computed\\ntomography scans (CT), and magnetic resonance ima-\\nging (MRI) may be done to determine which organs\\nare affected. Bladder cancer generally tends to spread\\nto the lungs, liver, and bone.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for bladder cancer depends on the\\nstage of the tumor. The patient’s medical history,\\noverall health status, and personal preferences also\\nare taken into account when deciding on an appropri-\\nate treatment plan. The three standard modes of treat-\\nment available for bladder cancer are surgery,\\nradiation therapy, and chemotherapy. In addition,\\nnewer treatment methods such as photodynamic ther-\\napy and immunotherapy also are being investigated in\\nclinical trials.\\nSurgery is considered an option only when the dis-\\nease is in its early stages.

A cytoscope is introduced into the blad-\\nder through the urethra, and the tumor is removed\\nthrough it. This procedure is called a transurethral\\nresection (TUR). Passing a high-energy laser beam\\nthrough the cytoscope and burning the cancer may\\ntreat any remaining cancer. This procedure is known\\nas electrofulguration. If the cancer has invaded the walls\\nof the bladder, surgery will be done through an incision\\nin the abdomen. Cancer that is not very large can be\\nremoved by partialcystectomy, a procedure where a\\npart of the bladder is removed. If the cancer is large or\\nis present in more than one area of the bladder, a radical\\ncystectomy is done. In this operation, the entire bladder\\nand adjoining organs also may be removed. In men, the\\nprostate is removed, while in women, the uterus, ovar-\\nies, and fallopian tubes are removed.\\nIf the entire urinary bladder is removed, an alter-\\nnate place must be created for the urine to be stored\\nbefore it is excreted out of the body. To do this, a piece\\nof intestine is converted into a small bag and attached\\nto the ureters. This is then connected to an opening\\n(stoma) that is made in the abdominal wall. The pro-\\ncedure is called a urostomy. In some urostomy proce-\\ndures, the urine from the intestinal sac is routed into a\\nbag that is placed over the stoma in the abdominal\\nwall. The bag is hidden by the clothing and has to be\\nemptied occasionally by the patient. In a different\\nprocedure, the urine is collected in the intestinal sac,\\nbut there is no bag on the outside of the abdomen. The\\nintestinal sac has to be emptied by the patient, by\\nplacing a drainage tube through the stoma.\\nRadiation therapy that uses high-energy rays to\\nkill cancer cells is generally used after surgery to\\nKEY TERMS\\nBiopsy— The surgical removal and microscopic\\nexamination of living tissue for diagnostic purposes.\\nChemotherapy— Treatment with anticancer drugs.\\nComputed tomography (CT) scan— A medical pro-\\ncedure where a series of x rays are taken and put\\ntogether by a computer in order to form detailed\\npictures of areas inside the body.\\nCystoscopy— A diagnostic procedure where a hol-\\nlow lighted tube, (cystoscope) is used to look inside\\nthe bladder and the urethra.\\nElectrofulguration— A procedure where a high-\\nenergy laser beam is used to burn the cancerous tissue.\\nImmunotherapy— Treatment of cancer by stimulat-\\ning the body’s immune defense system.\\nIntravenous pyelogram (IVP)— A procedure where a\\ndye is injected into a vein in the arm.

If the tumor is in a\\nlocation that makes surgery difficult, or if it is large,\\nradiation may be used before surgery to shrink the\\ntumor. In cases of advanced bladder cancer, radiation\\ntherapy is used to ease the symptoms such aspain,\\nbleeding, or blockage. Radiation can be delivered by\\nexternal beam, where a source of radiation that is\\noutside the body focuses the radiation on the area of\\nthe tumor. Occasionally, a small pellet of radioactive\\nmaterial may be placed directly into the cancer. This is\\nknown as interstitial radiation therapy.\\nChemotherapy uses anticancer drugs to destroy\\nthe cancer cells that may have migrated to distant\\nsites. The drugs are introduced into the bloodstream\\nby injecting them into a vein in the arm or taking\\nthem orally in pill form. Generally a combination of\\ndrugs is more effective than any single drug in treating\\nbladder cancer. Chemotherapy may be given follow-\\ning surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells. It also\\nmay be given even when no remaining cancer cells\\ncan be seen. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy.\\nAnticancer drugs, including thiotepa, doxorubicin,\\nand mitomycin, also may be instilled directly into\\nthe bladder (intravesicular chemotherapy) to treat\\nsuperficial tumors. In 2003, the FDA was giving fast\\ntrack designation to a form of paclitaxel, a common\\nanticancer drug, that was shown effective in treating\\nmetastatic or locally advanced bladder cancer.\\nA 2003 report stated that giving patients with blad-\\nder cancer chemotherapy followed by surgery may\\nimprove their outcomes. In the study of 307 patients,\\nthose with this combination of therapy lived two\\nyears longer than those treated with surgery only.\\nImmunotherapy, or biological therapy, uses the\\nbody’s own immune cells to fight the disease. To treat\\nsuperficial bladder cancer, bacille Calmette-Guerin\\n(BCG) may be instilled directly into the bladder. BCG\\nis a weakened (attenuated) strain of thetuberculosis\\nbacillus that stimulates the body’s immune system to\\nfight the cancer. This therapy has been shown to be\\neffective in controlling superficial bladder cancer.\\nPhotodynamic treatment is a novel mode of treat-\\nment that uses special chemicals and light to kill the\\ncancerous cells. First, a drug is introduced into the\\nbladder that makes the cancer cells more susceptible\\nto light. Following that, a special light is shone on the\\nbladder in an attempt to destroy the cancerous cells.\\nNew treatments are continuously being investi-\\ngated. Scientists have made great strides in gene map-\\nping and research in the twenty-first century. In 2003,\\na type ofgene therapy was being tested on patients\\nwith bladder cancer with success, but further enhance-\\nments were needed.\\nPrognosis\\nWhen detected in early stages, the prognosis for\\nthose with bladder cancer is excellent. At least 94% of\\npeople survive five years or more after initial diagno-\\nsis. However, if the disease has spread to the nearby\\ntissues, the survival rate drops to 49%. If it has metas-\\ntasized to distant organs such as the lung and liver,\\ncommonly only 6% of patients will survive five years\\nor more. As newer treatment methods are developed,\\nsome prognoses improve. For example, neoadjuvant\\nchemotherapy, or giving certain chemotherapy drugs\\nfollowing surgery, may help people live up to\\n31 months longer than previous treatments allowed.\\nPrevention\\nSince the exact causes of bladder cancer are not\\nknown, there is no certain way to prevent it. Avoiding\\nrisk factors whenever possible is the best alternative.\\nSince smoking doubles one’s risk of getting blad-\\nder cancer, avoiding tobacco may prevent at least half\\nthe deaths that result from bladder cancer. Taking\\nappropriate safety precautions when working with\\norganic cancer-causing chemicals is another way of\\npreventing the disease. Women should discuss the\\nrisks vs. benefits of hormone replacement therapy\\nwith their physicians.\\nIf a person has had a history of bladder cancer, or\\nhas been exposed to cancer-causing chemicals, he or\\nshe is considered to be at an increased risk of getting\\nbladder cancer. Similarly,kidney stones, frequent urin-\\nary infections, and other conditions that cause long-\\nterm irritation to the bladder also increase the chance\\nof getting the disease. In such cases, it is advisable to\\nundergo regular screening tests such as urine cytology,\\ncystoscopy and x rays of the urinary tract, so that\\nbladder cancer can be detected at its early stages and\\ntreated appropriately.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nGood, Brian. ‘‘Battle Against Bladder Cancer.’’Men’s\\nHealth 18 (December 2003): 32.\\nGrossman, H.

These types of stones are much less\\ncommon thankidney stones.\\nDescription\\nBladder stones can form anywhere in the urinary\\ntract before depositing in the bladder. They begin as tiny\\ngranules about the size of a grain of sand, but they can\\ngrow to more than an inch in diameter. These stones\\ncan block the flow of urine causingpain and difficulty\\nwith urination. They can also scratch the bladder\\nwall, which may lead to bleeding or infection.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhile the exact causes of the formation of bladder\\nstones are not completely understood, bladder stones\\nusually occur because of urinary tract infection (UTI),\\nobstruction of the urinary tract, enlargement of the\\nprostate gland in men, or the presence of foreign\\nbodies in the urinary tract. Diet and the amount of\\nfluid intake also appear to be important factors in the\\ndevelopment of bladder stones.\\nNinety-five percent of all bladder stones occur\\nin men, most of who have anenlarged prostategland or\\na UTI. These stones are rarely seen in children or\\nin African Americans. People withgout may deve-\\nlop bladder stones composed almost entirely of uric acid.\\nThe symptoms of bladder stones may become\\nevident when the wall of the bladder is scratched or\\nwhen the urinary tract becomes obstructed by the\\nstone.

Blastomycosis may be limited\\nto the lungs or also involve the skin and bones. In its\\nmost severe form, the infection can spread throughout\\nthe body and involve many organ systems (systemic).\\nDescription\\nBlastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by\\nBlastomyces dermatitidis. Although primarily an air-\\nborne disease, farmers and gardeners may become\\ninfected from contact with spores in the soil through\\ncuts and scrapes. The fungus that causes the disease is\\nfound in moist soil and wood in the southeastern\\nUnited States, the Mississippi River valley, southern\\nCanada, and Central America. Blastomycosis is also\\ncalled Gilchrist’s disease, Chicago disease, or North\\nAmerican blastomycosis. Another South and Central\\nAmerican disease, paracoccidioidomycosis, is some-\\ntimes called South American blastomycosis, but\\ndespite the similar name, this disease is substantially\\ndifferent from North American blastomycosis. Canine\\nblastomycosis, a common dog disease, is caused by the\\nsame fungus that infects humans. However, people do\\nnot get this disease from their dogs except only very\\nrarely through dog bites.\\nBlastomycosis is a rare disease infecting only\\nabout 4 in every 100,000 people. It is at least six\\ntimes more common in men than in women and\\ntends to more often infect children and individuals in\\nthe 30–50 year old age group.

Although peo-\\nple with AIDS can get blastomycosis because of their\\nweakened immune system, blastomycosis has not been\\none of the more common fungal infections associated\\nwith AIDS.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOnce inhaled, the spores ofB. dermatitidis can\\nlodge in the lungs and cause a localized inflammation.\\nThis is known as primary pulmonary blastomycosis.\\nThe disease does not spread from one person to\\nanother. In the early stages, symptoms may include a\\ndry cough, fever, heavy sweating, fatigue, and a general\\nfeeling of ill health. In approximately 25% of blasto-\\nmycosis cases, only the lungs are affected. As the dis-\\nease progresses, small lesions form in the lungs causing\\nthe air sacs deep within the lungs (alveoli) to break\\ndown and form small cavities.\\nIn another 35%, the disease involves both the\\nlungs and the skin. Bumps develop on the skin,\\ngradually becoming small, white, crusted blisters\\nfilled with pus. The blisters break open, creating\\nabscesses that do not heal. Approximately 19% of\\ninfected people have skin sores without infection in\\nthe lungs.\\nThe remaining approximately 20% of the\\ninfected population has blastomycosis that has\\nspread or disseminated to other systems of the\\nbody. Symptoms may includepain and lesions on\\none or more bones, the male genitalia, and/or parts\\nof the central nervous system. The liver, spleen,\\nlymph nodes, heart, adrenal glands, and digestive\\nsystem may also be infected.\\nDiagnosis\\nA positive diagnosis of blastomycosis is made when\\nthe fungusB. dermatitidisis identified by direct micro-\\nscopic examination of body fluids such as sputum and\\nprostate fluid or in tissue samples (biopsies) from the\\nlung or skin. Another way to diagnose blastomycosis is\\nto culture and isolate the fungus from a sample of\\nsputum. Chest x rays are used to assess lung damage,\\nbut alone cannot lead to a definitive diagnosis of blas-\\ntomycosis because any damage caused by other dis-\\neases, such as by pneumonia or tuberculosis,m a y\\nappear look on the x ray. Because its symptoms vary\\nwidely, blastomycosis is often misdiagnosed.\\nTreatment\\nBlastomycosis must be treated or it will gradually\\nlead to death. Treatment with the fungicidal drug\\nketoconazole (Nizoral) taken orally is effective in\\nabout 75% of patients. Amphotericin B (Fungizone)\\ngiven intravenously is also very effective, but it has\\nmore toxic side effects than ketoconazole. Treatment\\nwith amphotericin B usually requires hospitalization,\\nand the patient may also receive other drugs to mini-\\nmize the its side effects.\\nBlastomycosis is usually attributed to contact with yeast-like\\nfungi.

It indicates how well platelets\\ninteract with blood vessel walls to formblood clots.\\nPurpose\\nBleeding time is used most often to detect quali-\\ntative defects of platelets, such as Von Willebrand’s\\ndisease. The test helps identify people who have\\ndefects in their platelet function. This is the ability\\nof blood to clot following a wound or trauma.\\nNormally, platelets interact with the walls of blood\\nvessels to cause a blood clot. There are many factors\\nin the clotting mechanism, and they are initiated by\\nplatelets. The bleeding time test is usually used on\\npatients who have a history of prolonged bleeding\\nafter cuts, or who have a family history of bleeding\\ndisorders. Also, the bleeding time test is sometimes\\nperformed as a preoperative test to determine a\\npatient’s likely bleeding response during and after\\nsurgery. However, in patients with no history of\\nbleeding problems, or who are not taking anti-\\ninflammatory drugs, the bleeding time test is not\\nusually necessary.\\nPrecautions\\nBefore administering the test, patients should be\\nquestioned about what medications they may be\\ntaking. Some medications will adversely affect the\\nresults of the bleeding time test. These medications\\ninclude anticoagulants,diuretics, anticancer drugs, sul-\\nfonamides, thiazide, aspirin and aspirin-containing\\npreparations, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\\ndrugs. The test may also be affected by anemia (a\\ndeficiency in red blood cells). Since the taking of\\naspirin or related drugs are the most common cause\\nof prolonged bleeding time, no aspirin should be taken\\ntwo weeks prior to the test.\\nDescription\\nThere are four methods to perform the bleeding\\ntest. The Ivy method is the traditional format for this\\ntest. In the Ivy method, a blood pressure cuff is\\nplaced on the upper arm and inflated to 40 mM\\nHg. A lancet or scalpel blade is used to make a stab\\nwound on the underside of the forearm. An auto-\\nmatic, spring-loaded blade device is most commonly\\nused to make a standard-sized cut.

These veins, because of their size, may have\\nlonger bleeding times, especially in people with\\nbleeding defects. The time from when the stab\\nwound is made until all bleeding has stopped is\\nmeasured and is called the bleeding time. Every 30\\nseconds, filter paper or a paper towel is used to draw\\noff the blood. The test is finished when bleeding has\\nstopped completely.\\nThe three other methods of performing the bleed-\\ning test are the template, modified template, and Duke\\nmethods. The template and modified template meth-\\nods are variations of the Ivy method. A blood pressure\\ncuff is used and the skin on the forearm prepared as in\\nthe Ivy method. A template is placed over the area to\\nbe stabbed and two incisions are made in the forearm\\nusing the template as a location guide. The main dif-\\nference between the template and the modified method\\nis the length of the cut made.\\nFor the Duke method, a nick is made in an ear\\nlobe or a fingertip is pricked to cause bleeding. As in\\nthe Ivy method, the test is timed from the start of\\nbleeding until bleeding is completely stopped. The\\ndisadvantage to the Duke method is that the pressure\\non the blood veins in the stab area is not constant and\\nthe results achieved are less reliable. The advantage to\\nthe Duke method is that no scar remains after the test.\\nThe other methods may result in a tiny, hairline scar\\nwhere the wound was made. However, this is largely a\\ncosmetic concern.\\nPreparation\\nThere is no special preparation required of the\\npatient for this test. The area to be stabbed should be\\nwiped clean with an alcohol pad. The alcohol should\\nbe left on the skin long enough for it to kill bacteria at\\nthe wound site. The alcohol must be removed before\\nstabbing the arm because alcohol will adversely affect\\nthe tests results by inhibiting clotting.\\nAftercare\\nIf a prolonged bleeding time is caused by unknown\\nfactors or diseases, further testing is required to identify\\nthe exact cause of the bleeding problem.\\nNormal results\\nA normal bleeding time for the Ivy method is less\\nthan five minutes from the time of the stab until all\\nbleeding from the wound stops. Some texts extend the\\nnormal range to eight minutes. Normal values for the\\ntemplate method range up to eight minutes, while for\\nthe modified template methods, up to 10 minutes is\\nconsidered normal. Normal for the Duke method is\\nthree minutes.\\nAbnormal results\\nA bleeding time that is longer than normal is an\\nabnormal result. The test should be stopped if the\\npatient hasn’t stopped bleeding by 20-30 minutes.\\nBleeding time is longer when the normal function of\\nplatelets is impaired, or there are a lower-than-normal\\nnumber of platelets in the blood.\\nA longer-than-normal bleeding time can indicate\\nthat one of several defects in hemostasis is present,\\nincluding severe thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunc-\\ntion, vascular defects, Von Willebrand’s disease, or\\nother abnormalities.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHenry, J.

Several proteins in the\\nbody are involved in the platelets clotting process.\\nChief among these proteins are collagen, thrombin,\\nand von Willebrand factor. Collagen and thrombin\\nhelp platelets stick together. As platelets gather at\\nthe site of injury, they change in shape from round\\nto spiny, releasing proteins and other substances\\nthat help catch more platelets and clotting proteins.\\nThis enlarges the plug that becomes a blood\\nclot. Formation of blood clots also is called\\n‘‘coagulation’’.\\nThe series of reactions that cause proteins and\\nplatelets to create blood clots also are balanced by\\nother reactions that stop the clotting process and dis-\\nsolve clots after the blood vessel has healed. If this\\ncontrol system fails, minor blood vessel injuries can\\ntrigger clotting throughout the body. The tendency to\\nclot too much is called ‘‘hypercoagulation’’. Anytime\\nclots form inside blood vessels, they can lead to serious\\ncomplications.\\nThe formation of a clot in a blood vessels may be\\ncalled thrombophlebitis. The term refers to swelling of\\none or more veins caused by a blood clot. Although\\nsome clots occur in the arms or small, surface blood\\nvessels, most occur in the lower legs. When the blood\\nclot occurs in a deep vein, it is calleddeep vein throm-\\nbosis, or DVT. As many as one of every 1,000\\nAmericans develops DVT each year. The danger of\\nDVT comes when pieces of the clot, known as emboli,\\nbreak off and travel through the bloodstream to an\\nartery.\\nA blood clot that blocks an artery to the brain can\\ncause a stroke. If the clot blocks blood flow to the\\nlungs pulmonary embolism can occur. A blood clot\\nthat blocks a coronary artery can cause aheart attack.\\nCertain people are at higher risk for blood clots than\\nothers; surgery, some injuries,childbirth and lying or\\nsitting still for extended periods of time put people at\\nhigher risk, as do inherited disorders. Once a person\\nhas a blood clot, he or she may have to take blood-\\nthinning drugs to prevent clots from recurring. Men\\nand women are at similar risk for blood clots. A recent\\nstudy in Austria found that men run a higher risk of\\nrecurring blood clots than women, though the reason\\nis unknown.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMany causes can lead to blood clots, some\\ngenetic and some environmental. An environmental\\ncause of DVT is prolonged inactivity. For instance,\\nhaving to sit in a car or airplane for a long period of\\ntime decreases blood flowin the lower legs. Recent\\nstudies have shown that 1% of air travelers develop\\nblood clots, usually on long flights of five hours or\\nmore. However, one study in 2004 found that air\\ntravelers developed clots onf l i g h t sa ss h o r ta st h r e e\\nhours, though they often dissolved naturally and did\\nnot lead to complications. Other environmental\\ncauses of blood clots include use ofhormone replace-\\nment therapy to ease menopausal symptoms, oral\\ncontraceptives for birth control, pregnancy (and a\\nchildbirth within the past six weeks), recent surgery\\nor procedures involving use of a centralvenous\\naccess catheter, and cancer. Smoking also is an\\nimportant and preventable environmental risk for\\nblood clots.\\nSome people are born with a higher risk for blood\\nclots. Hypercoagulation disorders are genetic condi-\\ntions. Usually the body doesn t produce enough of\\nthe proteins involved in the clotting process, so they\\ncannot do their job to stop the clotting; in other cases,\\nthey have an extra protein that causes too much\\nclotting.\\nKEY TERMS\\nCentral venous access catheter— A tube placed\\njust beneath the skin to allow doctors and nurses\\nconstant and pain-free access to the veins, often\\nwhen a patient is in the hospital or has a chronic\\ndisease such as cancer.

Ultrasound does\\nnot use x rays and is a noninvasive method. Computed\\ntomography (CT) scans also might be used to image\\nthe blood vessels. It is similar to x rays, except the\\nimages are much like cross-section slices with greater\\ndetail that can be computerized and even viewed three-\\ndimensionally. A special dye called a contrast agent\\nmay be injected before the exam to help highlight the\\nveins. Magnetic resonanceangiography uses magnetic\\nresonance imaging(MRI) to image the blood vessels.\\nIt also may involve injection of a contrast dye.\\nVenographyis less commonly used, but involves inject-\\ning a contrast and using x rays to image the vein.\\nTreatment\\nMedicines can help thin blood, making it less\\nlikely to clot. The two most common blood thin-\\nners are heparin and warfarin. Heparin works\\nright away, keeping blood clots from growing. It\\nusually is injected. In re cent years, more physi-\\ncians have been prescribing low-molecular weight\\nheparin, purified versions of the drug that can be\\ngiven with less monitoring. Warfarin (coumadin)\\noften is used for long-term treatment of blood\\nclots and is taken orally.

The same can be true of\\nlow-molecular weight heparin when used on a\\nlong-term, at-home basis.\\nOther treatments for blood clots include injecting\\nclot busting drugs directly into the clot through a\\ncatheter, or in rare instances, installation of a filter to\\nblock a clot from lodging in the lungs. Sometimes,\\nsurgery also is needed to remove a clot blocking a\\npelvic or abdominal vein or one that is chronic and\\ndisabling. A cardiovascular surgeon or interventional\\nradiologist may perform balloonangioplasty or insert\\na stent to open a narrowed or damaged vein.

Odle\\nBlood count\\nDefinition\\nOne of the most commonly ordered clinical\\nlaboratory tests, a blood count, also called a com-\\nplete blood count (CBC), is a basic evaluation of\\nthe cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and plate-\\nlets) suspended in the liquid part of the blood\\n(plasma). It involves determining the numbers, con-\\ncentrations, and conditions of the different types of\\nblood cells.\\nPurpose\\nThe CBC is a useful screening and diagnostic test\\nthat is often done as part of a routinephysical exam-\\nination. It can provide valuable information about the\\nblood and blood-forming tissues (especially the bone\\nmarrow), as well as other body systems. Abnormal\\nresults can indicate the presence of a variety of condi-\\ntions—includinganemias, leukemias, and infections—\\nsometimes before the patient experiences symptoms of\\nthe disease.\\nDescription\\nA complete blood count is actually a series of tests\\nin which the numbers of red blood cells, white blood\\ncells, and platelets in a given volume of blood are\\ncounted. The CBC also measures the hemoglobin con-\\ntent and the packed cell volume (hematocrit) of the red\\nblood cells, assesses the size and shape of the red blood\\ncells, and determines the types and percentages of\\nwhite blood cells. Components of the complete blood\\ncount (hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cells,\\nplatelets, etc.) can also be tested separately, and are\\nsometimes done that way when a doctor wants to\\nmonitor a specific condition, such as the white cell\\ncount of a patient diagnosed with leukemia, or the\\nhemoglobin of a patient who has recently received a\\nblood transfusion. Because of its value, though, as an\\nindicator of a person’s overall health, the CBC pack-\\nage is most frequently ordered.\\nThe blood count is performed relatively inexpen-\\nsively and quickly. Most laboratories routinely use\\nsome type of automated equipment to dilute the\\nblood, sample a measured volume of the diluted sus-\\npension, and count the cells in that volume. In addi-\\ntion to counting actual numbers of red cells, white\\ncells, and platelets, the automated cell counters also\\nmeasure the hemoglobin and calculate the hematocrit\\nand thered blood cell indices(measures of the size and\\nhemoglobin content of the red blood cells).\\n580 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBlood count'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 610, 'page_label': '611'}, page_content='Technologists then examine a stained blood smear\\nunder the microscope to identify any abnormalities\\nin the appearance of the red blood cells and to report\\nthe types and percentages of white blood cells\\nobserved.\\nThe red blood cell (RBC) count determines the\\ntotal number of red cells (erythrocytes) in a sample of\\nblood. The red cells, the most numerous of the cellu-\\nlar elements, carry oxygen from the lungs to the\\nbody’s tissues. Hemoglobin (Hgb) is the protein-\\niron compound in the red blood cells that enables\\nthem to transport oxygen. Its concentration corre-\\nsponds closely to the RBC count. Also closely tied\\nto the RBC and hemoglobin values is the hematocrit\\n(Hct), which measures the percentage of red blood\\ncells in the total blood volume. The hematocrit\\n(expressed as percentage points) is normally about\\nthree times the hemoglobin concentration (reported\\nas grams per deciliter).\\nRed blood cell indices provide information\\nabout the size and hemoglobin content of the red\\ncells. They are useful in differentiating types of ane-\\nmias. The indices include four measurements that are\\ncalculated using the RBC count, hemoglobin, and\\nhematocrit results. Mean corpuscular volume\\n( M C V )i sam e a s u r e m e n to ft h ea v e r a g es i z eo ft h e\\nred blood cells and indicates whether that is small,\\nlarge or normal.

A similar measurement, mean corpuscular\\nhemoglobin concentration (MCHC), expresses the\\naverage concentration of hemoglobin in the red\\nblood cells.\\nThe white blood cell (WBC) count determines the\\ntotal number of white cells (leukocytes) in the blood\\nsample. Fewer in number than the red cells, WBCs\\nare the body’s primary means of fighting infection.\\nThere are five main types of white cells (neutrophils,\\nlymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and baso-\\nphils), each of which plays a different role in respond-\\ning to the presence of foreign organisms in the body.\\nA differential white cell count is done by staining a\\nsmear of the patient’s blood with a Wright’s stain,\\nallowing the different types of white cells to be clearly\\nseen under the microscope. A technologist then\\ncounts a minimum of 100 WBCs and reports each\\ntype of white cell as a percentage of the total white\\nblood cells counted.\\nThe platelet countis an actual count of the number\\nof platelets (thrombocytes) in a given volume of blood.\\nPlatelets, the smallest of the cellular elements of blood,\\nare involved in blood clotting. Because platelets\\ncan clump together, the automated counting method\\nis subject to a certain level of error and may not\\nbe accurate enough for low platelet counts. For this\\nreason, very low platelet levels are often counted\\nmanually.\\nNormal results\\nBlood count values can vary by age and sex. The\\nnormal red blood cell count ranges from 4.2–5.4 mil-\\nlion RBCs per microliter of blood for men and 3.6–5.0\\nmillion for women. Hemoglobin values range\\nfrom 14–18 grams per deciliter of blood for men and\\n12–16 grams for women. The normal hematocrit is\\n42–54% for men and 36–48% for women. The normal\\nnumber of white blood cells for both men and women\\nis approximately 4,000–10,000 WBCs per microliter of\\nblood.\\nAbnormal results\\nAbnormal blood count results are seen in a vari-\\nety of conditions. One of the most common is ane-\\nmias, which are characterized by low RBC counts,\\nhemoglobins, and hematocrits.

If a\\nmicroorganism is found, more testing is done to deter-\\nmine theantibiotics that will be effective in treating the\\ninfection.\\nPurpose\\nBacteremia is a serious clinical condition and can\\nlead to death. To give the best chance for effective\\ntreatment and survival, a blood culture is done as\\nsoon as an infection is suspected.\\nSymptoms of bacteremia arefever, chills, mental\\nconfusion, anxiety, rapid heart beat, hyperventilation,\\nblood clotting problems, andshock. These symptoms\\nare especially significant in a person who already has\\nanother illness or infection, is hospitalized, or has\\ntrouble fighting infections because of a weak immune\\nsystem. Often, the blood infection results from an\\ninfection somewhere else in the body that has now\\nspread.\\nAdditionally, blood cultures are done to find the\\ncauses of other infections. These include bacterial\\npneumonia (an infection of the lung), and infectious\\nendocarditis (an infection of the inner layer of the\\nheart). Both of these infections leak bacteria into the\\nblood.\\nAfter a blood infection has been diagnosed, con-\\nfirmed by culture, and treated, an additional blood\\nculture may be done to make sure the infection is\\ngone.\\nDescription\\nCulture strategies\\nThere are many variables involved in performing\\na blood culture. Before the person’s blood is drawn,\\nthe physician must make several decisions based on a\\nknowledge of infections and the person’s clinical con-\\ndition and medical history.\\nSeveral groups of microorganisms, including\\nbacteria, viruses, mold, and yeast, can cause blood\\ninfections. The bacteriagroup can be further broken\\ndown into aerobes and anaerobes. Most aerobes do\\nnot need oxygen to live. They can grow with oxygen\\n(aerobic microbes) or without oxygen (anaerobic\\nmicrobes).\\nBased on the clinical condition of the patient, the\\nphysician determines what group of microorganisms\\nis likely to be causing the infection and then orders\\none or more specific types of blood culture, including\\naerobic, anaerobic, viral, or fungal (for yeasts and\\nmolds). Each specific type of culture is handled differ-\\nently by the laboratory. Most blood cultures test for\\nboth aerobic and anaerobic microbes. Fungal, viral,\\nand mycobacterial blood cultures can also be done,\\nbut are less common.\\nThe physician must also decide how many blood\\ncultures should be done. One culture is rarely\\nenough, but two to three are usually adequate.\\nFour cultures are occasionally required.

Since microorganisms enter the\\nblood 30–90 minutes bef ore the person’s fever\\nspikes, collecting the culture just after the fever\\nspike offers the best likelihood of finding the micro-\\norganism.

During continu-\\nous bacteremia, such as infective endocarditis,\\nmicroorganisms are always in the blood and the\\ntiming of culture collection is less important. Blood\\ncultures should always be collected before antibiotic\\ntreatment has begun.\\nLaboratory analysis\\nBacteria are the most common microorganisms\\nfound in blood infections. Laboratory analysis of a\\nbacterial blood culture differs slightly from that of a\\nfungal culture and significantly from that of a viral\\nculture.\\nBlood is drawn from a person and put directly\\ninto a blood culture bottle containing a nutritional\\nbroth. After the laboratory receives the blood culture\\nbottle, several processes must be completed:\\n/C15provide an environment for the bacteria to grow\\n/C15detect the growth when it occurs\\n/C15identify the bacteria that grow\\n/C15test the bacteria against certain antibiotics to deter-\\nmine which antibiotic will be effective\\nThere are several types of systems, both manual\\nand automated, available to laboratories to carry out\\nthese processes.\\nThe broth in the blood culture bottle is the first\\nstep in creating an environment in which bacteria will\\ngrow. It contains all the nutrients that bacteria need to\\ngrow. If the physician expects anaerobic bacteria to\\ngrow, oxygen will be kept out of the blood culture\\nbottle; if aerobes are expected, oxygen will be allowed\\nin the bottle.\\nThe bottles are placed in an incubator and kept at\\nbody temperature. They are watched daily for signs of\\ngrowth, including cloudiness or a color change in the\\nbroth, gas bubbles, or clumps of bacteria. When there\\nis evidence of growth, the laboratory does a gram stain\\nand a subculture. To do the gram stain, a drop of\\nblood is removed from the bottle and placed on a\\nmicroscope slide. The blood is allowed to dry and\\nthen is stained with purple and red stains and exam-\\nined under the microscope. If bacteria are seen, the\\ncolor of stain they picked up (purple or red), their\\nshape (such as round or rectangular), and their size\\nprovide valuable clues as to what type of microorgan-\\nism they are and what antibiotics might work best. To\\ndo the subculture, a drop of blood is placed on a\\nculture plate, spread over the surface, and placed in\\nan incubator.\\nIf there is no immediate visible evidence of growth\\nin the bottles, the laboratory looks for bacteria by\\ndoing gram stains and subcultures. These steps are\\nrepeated daily for the first several days and periodi-\\ncally after that.\\nWhen bacteria grows, the laboratory identifies it\\nusing biochemical tests and the gram stain. Sensitivity\\ntesting, also called antibiotic susceptibility testing, is\\nalso done. The bacteria are tested against many differ-\\nent antibiotics to see which antibiotics can effectively\\nkill it.\\nAll information is passed on to the physician as\\nsoon as it is known. An early report, known as a\\npreliminary report, is usually available after one day.\\nThis report will tell if any bacteria have been found\\nyet, and if so, the results of the gram stain. The next\\npreliminary report may include a description of the\\nbacteria growing on the subculture. The laboratory\\nnotifies the physician immediately when an organism\\nis found and as soon as sensitivity tests are complete.\\nSensitivity tests may be complete before the bacteria\\nis completely identified.

All of that blood must be\\ncollected, tested, prepared, stored, and delivered\\nto the appropriate sites. Roughly eight million\\npeople in the United States donate blood each year;\\nabout half of the total amount needed is provided\\nby the 36 regional blood centers of the American\\nRed Cross.\\nWhole blood and the various blood components\\nhave many uses. Red blood cells, which carry oxygen,\\nare used to treat anemia. Platelets, which play a role in\\ncontrolling bleeding, are commonly used in the treat-\\nment of leukemia and other cancers. Fresh frozen\\nplasma is also used to control bleeding in people defi-\\ncient in certain clotting factors. Cryoprecipitated\\nAHF, made from fresh frozen plasma, contains a few\\nspecific clotting factors.\\nPrecautions\\nTo ensure the safety of the blood supply, a multi-\\ntiered process of donor screening and deferral is\\nemployed. This involves donor education, taking a\\ndetailed health history of each prospective donor, and\\ngiving potential donors a simplephysical examination\\n(which includes taking a few drops of blood to test for\\nanemia). At any point in the process, a potential donor\\nmay be ‘‘deferred,’’ or judged ineligible to donate blood.\\nThis deferral may be temporary or permanent, depend-\\ning on the reason. Potential donors are also encouraged\\nto ‘‘self-defer,’’ or voluntarily decline to donate, rather\\nthan put future blood recipients at risk.\\nAll donated blood is extensively tested before\\nbeing used. The first step is determining the blood\\ntype, which indicates who can receive the blood.\\nReceiving the wrong type of blood can cause\\ndeath. Blood is also screened for any antibodies that\\ncould cause complications for recipients. In addition,\\nblood is tested to screen out donors infected with\\nthe following diseases:Hepatitis B surface antigen\\nADD, hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis C\\nvirus antibody, HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody, HIV p24\\nantigen, HTLV-I and HTLV-II antibodies, and\\nsyphilis. Nucleic Acid Amplification testing is also\\nperformed, and other tests may be done if a doctor\\nrequests them.\\nIn order to detect the greatest possible number of\\ninfections, these screening tests are extremely sensi-\\ntive. For this reason, however, donors sometimes\\nreceive false positive test results. In these cases,\\nmore specific confirmatory tests are performed, to\\nhelp rule out false positive results. Blood found to\\nbe abnormal is discarded, and all items coming into\\ndirect contact with donors are used only once and\\nthen discarded. Donors of infected blood are entered\\ninto the Donor Deferral Register, a confidential\\nnational data base used to prevent deferred people\\nfrom donating blood.\\nIn general, blood donors must be at least 17 years\\nold (some states allow younger people to donate blood\\nwith their parents’ consent), must weigh at least 110\\npounds (50 kg), and must be in good health.\\nMany factors can temporarily or permanently\\ndisqualify potential donors. Most of them have to\\ndo with having engaged in behaviors that put them\\nat risk of infection or having spent time in certain\\nspecified areas. Among these factors are having had a\\ntattoo, having had sex with people in high-risk\\ngroups, having had certain diseases, and having\\nbeen raped.\\nDescription\\nThere are eight different blood types in all—four\\nABO groups, each of which may be either Rh positive\\nor Rh negative. These types, and their approximate\\ndistribution in the U.S. population, are as follows:\\nO+ (38%), O- (7%), A+ (34%), A- (6%), B+ (9%),\\nB- (2%), AB+ (3%), AB- (1%).

The person pricks his or her finger (a\\nfinger stick) with a sterile sharp blade from the kit. A\\nsingle drop of blood is placed on a strip in a portable\\ninstrument called a glucometer. The glucometer\\nquickly determines the blood sugar and shows the\\nresults on a small screen in usually a few seconds.\\nNew technologies for monitoring glucose levels\\nwill help diabetics better control their glucose levels.\\nThese tests are particularly important for children\\nand adolescents.

The blood sample is collected into\\na tube containing an anticoagulant. Anticoagulants\\nstop the blood from clotting. In the laboratory, the\\ntube of blood spins at high speed within a machine\\ncalled a centrifuge. The blood cells sink to the bottom\\nand the liquid stays on the top. This straw-colored\\nliquid on the top is the plasma. To measure the\\nglucose, a person’s plasma is combined with other\\nsubstances. From the resulting reaction, the amount\\nof glucose in the plasma is determined.\\nOral glucose tolerance test\\nThe oral glucose tolerance test is conducted to see\\nhow well the body handles a standard amount of\\nglucose. This test measures the amount of glucose in\\na person’s plasma before and two hours after drinking\\na large premeasured beverage containing glucose. The\\nperson must eat a consistent diet, containing at least\\n5.25 oz (150g) of carbohydrates each day, for three\\ndays before this test. For eight hours before the test,\\nthe person must fast. A health care provider draws the\\nfirst sample of blood at the end of the fast to determine\\nthe glucose level at the start of the test.

If the person needs a blood\\ntransfusion, another test called crossmatching is done\\nafter the blood is typed to find blood from a donor\\nthat the person’s body will accept.\\nPurpose\\nBlood typing and crossmatching are most com-\\nmonly done to make certain that a person who needs a\\ntransfusion will receive blood that matches (is compa-\\ntible with) his own. People must receive blood of the\\nsame blood type, otherwise, a serious, even fatal,\\ntransfusion reaction can occur.\\nParents who are expecting a baby have their blood\\ntyped to diagnose and prevent hemolytic disease of the\\nnewborn (HDN), a type of anemia also known as\\nerythroblastosis fetalis. Babies who have a blood type\\ndifferent from their mothers are at risk for developing\\nthis disease. The disease is serious with certain blood\\ntype differences, but is milder with others.\\nA child inherits factors or genes from each parent\\nthat determine his blood type. This fact makes blood\\ntyping useful in paternity testing. To determine\\nwhether or not the alleged father could be the true\\nfather, the blood types of the child, mother, and\\nalleged father are compared.\\nLegal investigations may require typing of blood\\nor other body fluids, such as semen or saliva, to iden-\\ntify persons involved in crimes or other legal matters.\\nDescription\\nBlood typing and crossmatching tests are per-\\nformed in a blood bank laboratory by technologists\\ntrained in blood bank and transfusion services. The\\ntests are done on blood, after it has separated into cells\\nand serum (serum is the yellow liquid left after the\\nblood clots.) Costs for both tests are covered by insur-\\nance when the tests are determined to be medically\\nnecessary.\\nBlood bank laboratories are usually located in\\nfacilities, such as those operated by the American\\nRed Cross, that collect, process, and supply blood\\nthat is donated, as well as in facilities, such as most\\nhospitals, that prepare blood for transfusion. These\\nlaboratories are regulated by the United States Food\\nand Drug Administration (FDA) and are often\\ninspected and accredited by a professional association\\nsuch as the American Association of Blood Banks\\n(AABB).\\nBlood typing and crossmatching tests are based\\non the reaction between antigens and antibodies. An\\nantigen can be anything that causes the body to launch\\nan attack, known as an immune response, against it.\\nThe attack begins when the body builds a special\\nprotein, called an antibody, that is uniquely designed\\nto attack and make ineffective (neutralize) the specific\\nantigen that caused the attack. A person’s body nor-\\nmally doesn’t make antibodies against its own anti-\\ngens, only against antigens that are foreign to it.\\nA person’s body contains many antigens. The anti-\\ngens found on the surface of red blood cells are impor-\\ntant because they determine a person’s blood type.\\nWhen red blood cells having a certain blood type anti-\\ngen are mixed with serum containing antibodies against\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 591\\nBlood typing and crossmatching'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 621, 'page_label': '622'}, page_content='that antigen, the antibodies attack and stick to the\\nantigen. In a test tube, this reaction is observed as the\\nformation of clumps of cells (clumping).\\nWhen blood is typed, a person’s cells and serum\\nare mixed in a test tube with commercially-prepared\\nserum and cells. Clumping tells which antigens or\\nantibodies are present and reveals the person’s blood\\ntype. When blood is crossmatched, patient serum\\nis mixed with cells from donated blood that might be\\nused for transfusion. Clumping or lack of clumping\\nin the test tube tells whether or not the blood is\\ncompatible.\\nAlthough there are over 600 known red blood cell\\nantigens, organized into 22 blood group systems, rou-\\ntine blood typing and crossmatching is usually con-\\ncerned with only two systems: the ABO and Rh blood\\ngroup systems.\\nBlood typing\\nABO BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM. In 1901, Karl\\nLandsteiner, an Austrian pathologist, randomly com-\\nbined the serum and red blood cells of his colleagues.\\nFrom the reactions he observed in test tubes, he dis-\\ncovered the ABO blood group system. This discovery\\nearned him the 1930 Nobel Prize in Medicine.\\nA person’s ABO blood type–A, B, AB, or O–is\\nbased on the presence or absence of the A and B\\nantigens on his red blood cells. The A blood type has\\nonly the A antigen and the B blood type has only the\\nB antigen. The AB blood type has both A and B\\nantigens, and the O blood type has neither A nor B\\nantigen.\\nBy the time a person is six months old, he natu-\\nrally will have developed antibodies against the anti-\\ngens his red blood cells lack. That is, a person with A\\nblood type will have anti-B antibodies, and a person\\nwith B blood type will have anti-A antibodies. A per-\\nson with AB blood type will have neither antibody, but\\na person with O blood type will have both anti-A and\\nanti-B antibodies. Although the distribution of each of\\nthe four ABO blood types varies between racial\\ngroups, O is the most common and AB is the least\\ncommon.\\nABO typing is the first test done on blood when it\\nis tested for transfusion. A person must receive ABO-\\nmatched blood. ABO incompatibilities are the major\\ncause of fatal transfusion reactions. ABO antigens are\\nalso found on most body organs, so ABO compatibil-\\nity is also important for organ transplants.\\nAn ABO incompatibility between a pregnant\\nwoman and her baby is a minor cause of HDN and\\nusually causes no problem for the baby. The structure\\nof ABO antibodies makes it unlikely they will cross the\\nplacenta to attack the baby’s red blood cells.\\nPaternity testing compares the ABO blood types of\\nthe child, mother, and alleged father. The alleged father\\ncan’t be the true father if the child’s blood type requires\\na gene that neither he nor the mother have. For exam-\\nple, a child with blood type B whose mother has blood\\ntype O, requires a father with either AB or B blood type;\\na man with blood type O cannot be the true father.\\nIn some people, ABO antigens can be found in\\nbody fluids other than blood, such as saliva and\\nsemen. ABO typing of these fluids provides clues in\\nlegal investigations.\\nRH BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM. The Rh, or Rhesus,\\nsystem was first detected in 1940 by Landsteiner and\\nWiener when they injected blood from rhesus monkeys\\ninto guinea pigs and rabbits. More than 50 antigens have\\nsince been discovered belonging to this system, making\\nit the most complex red blood cell antigen system.\\nIn routine blood typing and crossmatching tests,\\nonly one of these 50 antigens, the D antigen, also\\nknown as the Rh factor or Rho[D], is tested for.\\nIf the D antigen is present, that person is Rh-positive;\\nif the D antigen is absent, that person is Rh-negative.\\nOther important antigens in the Rh system are C,\\nc, E, and e. These antigens are not usually tested for in\\nroutine blood typing tests. However, testing for the\\npresence of these antigens is useful in paternity testing,\\nand when a technologist tries to identify unexpected\\nFrequency (%) Of ABO And Rh Blood Types In U.S. Population\\nRacial Group ABO Blood Type Rh Blood Type\\nO A B AB Positive Negative\\nWhites 45% 40% 11% 4% 85% 15%\\nBlacks 49% 27% 20% 4% 90% 10%\\n592 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBlood typing and crossmatching'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 622, 'page_label': '623'}, page_content=\"Rh antibodies or find matching blood for a person\\nwith antibodies to one or more of these antigens.\\nUnlike the ABO system, antibodies to Rh anti-\\ngens don’t develop naturally.

Most Rh-negative people\\nwho receive Rh-positive blood will develop anti-D\\nantibodies. A later transfusion of Rh-positive blood\\ncould result in a severe or fatal transfusion reaction.\\nRh incompatibility is the most common and\\nsevere cause of HDN. This incompatibility can\\nhappen when an Rh-negative woman and an Rh-\\npositive man produce an Rh-positive baby. Cells\\nfrom the baby can cross the placenta and enter the\\nmother’s bloodstream, causing the mother to make\\nanti-D antibodies. Unlike ABO antibodies, the struc-\\nture of anti-D antibodies makes it likely that they will\\ncross the placenta and enter the baby’s bloodstream.\\nThere, they can destroy the baby’s red blood cells,\\ncausing severe or fatal anemia.\\nThe first step in preventing HDN is to find out\\nthe Rh types of the expectant parents.

Several other\\nblood group systems may be involved in HDN and\\ntransfusion reactions, although they are much less\\nfrequent than ABO and Rh. They are the Duffy,\\nKell, Kidd, MNS, and P systems. Tests for antigens\\nfrom these systems are not included in routine blood\\ntyping, but they are commonly used in paternity\\ntesting.\\nLike Rh antibodies, antibodies in these systems\\ndo not develop naturally, but as an immune response\\nafter transfusion or during pregnancy. An antibody\\nscreening test is done before a crossmatch to check\\nfor unexpected antibodies to antigens in these sys-\\ntems. A person’s serum is mixed in a test tube with\\ncommercially-prepared cells containing antigens\\nfrom these systems. If clumping occurs, the antibody\\nis identified.\\nCrossmatching\\nCrossmatching is the final step in pretransfusion\\ntesting. It is commonly referred to as compatibility\\ntesting, or ‘‘Type and Cross.’’\\nBefore blood from a donor and the recipient are\\ncrossmatched, both are ABO and Rh typed. In addi-\\ntion, antibody screening is done to look for antibo-\\ndies to certain Rh, Duffy, MNS, Kell, Kidd, and\\nP system antigens. If an antibody to one of these\\nantigens is found, only blood without that antigen\\nwill be compatible in a crossmatch. This sequence\\nmust be repeated before each transfusion a person\\nreceives.\\nTo begin the crossmatch, blood from a donor with\\nthe same ABO and Rh type as the rcipient is selected.\\nIn a test tube, serum from the patient is mixed with red\\nblood cells from the donor. If clumping occurs, the\\nblood is not compatible; if clumping does not occur,\\nthe blood is compatible. If an unexpected antibody is\\nfound in either the patient or the donor, the blood\\nbank does further testing to make sure the blood is\\ncompatible.\\nIn an emergency, when there is not enough time\\nfor blood typing and crossmatching, O red blood cells\\nmay be given, preferably Rh-negative. O blood type is\\ncalled the universal donor because it has no ABO\\nantigens for a patient’s antibodies to attack. In con-\\ntrast, AB blood type is called the universal recipient\\nbecause it has no ABO antibodies to attack the anti-\\ngens on transfused red blood cells. If there is time\\nfor blood typing, red blood cells of the recipient type\\n(type specific cells) are given.

The diag-\\nnostic criteria specify that the condition must be suffi-\\nciently severe to cause a decline in the patient’s social,\\noccupational, or educational functioning. The most\\ncommon cause of this decline is the time lost\\nin obsessing about the ‘‘defect’’—one study found\\nthat 68 percent of patients in a sample of adolescents\\ndiagnosed with BDD spent three or more hours every\\nday thinking about the body part or facial feature of\\nconcern. DSM-IV assigns BDD to the larger category\\nofsomatoform disorders, which are disorders charac-\\nterized by physical complaints that appear to be\\nmedical in origin but that cannot be explained in\\nterms of a physical disease, the results ofsubstance\\nabuse, or by another mental disorder.\\nThe earliest known case of BDD in the medical\\nliterature was reported by an Italian physician named\\nEnrique Morselli in 1886, but the disorder was not\\ndefined as a formal diagnostic category until DSM-\\nIII-R in 1987. The World Health Organization\\n(WHO) did not add BDD to the International\\nClassification of Diseases (ICD) until 1992. The\\nworddysmorphic comes from two Greek words that\\nmean ‘‘bad’’ or ‘‘ugly’’ and ‘‘shape’’ or ‘‘form.’’ BDD\\nwas previously known as dysmorphophobia.\\nDescription\\nBDD is characterized by an unusual degree of\\nworry or concern about a specific part of the face or\\nbody, rather than the general size or shape of the body.\\nIt is distinguished fromanorexia nervosaand bulimia\\nnervosa in that patients with eating disorders are\\npreoccupied with their overall weight and body\\nshape. As many as 50 percent of patients diagnosed\\nwith BDD undergo plastic surgery to correct their\\nperceived physical defects.\\nSince the publication of DSM-IV in 1994, some\\npsychiatrists have suggested that there is a subtype of\\nBDD, namely muscle dysmorphia. Muscle dysmor-\\nphia is marked by excessive concern with one’s mus-\\ncularity and/or fitness. Persons with muscle\\ndysmorphia spend unusual amounts of time working\\nout in gyms or exercising rather than dieting obses-\\nsively or seeking plastic surgery.

Some patients with BDD are aware\\nthat their concerns are excessive, but others do\\nnot have this degree of insight; about 50 percent\\nof patients diagnosed with BDD also meet the\\ncriteria for a delusional disorder.\\nThe usual age of onset of BDD is late childhood or\\nearly adolescence; the average age of patients diag-\\nnosed with the disorder is 17. BDD has a high rate of\\ncomorbidity, which means that people diagnosed with\\nthe disorder are highly likely to have been diagnosed\\nwith another psychiatric disorder—most commonly\\nmajor depression, social phobia, orobsessive-compul-\\nsive disorder (OCD). About 29% of patients with\\nBDD eventually try to commitsuicide.\\nBDD is thought to affect 1–2 percent of the gen-\\neral population in the United States and Canada,\\nalthough some doctors think that it is underdiagnosed\\nbecause it coexists so often with depression and other\\ndisorders. In addition, patients are often ashamed of\\ngrooming rituals and other behaviors associated with\\nBDD, and may avoid telling their doctor about them.\\nBDD is thought to affect men and women equally;\\nhowever, there are no reliable data as of the early\\n2000s regarding racial or ethnic differences in the inci-\\ndence of the disorder.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe causes of BDD fall into two major categories,\\nneurobiological and psychosocial.\\nNEUROBIOLOGICAL CAUSES. Research indicates\\nthat patients diagnosed with BDD have serotonin\\nlevels that are lower than normal. Serotonin is a neu-\\nrotransmitter— a chemical produced by the brain that\\nhelps to transmit nerve impulses across the junctions\\nbetween nerve cells. Low serotonin levels are asso-\\nciated with depression and othermood disorders.\\nPSYCHOSOCIAL CAUSES. Another important fac-\\ntor in the development of BDD is the influence of the\\nmass media in developed countries, particularly the\\nrole of advertising in spreading images of physically\\n‘‘perfect’’ men and women. Impressionable children\\nand adolescents absorb the message that anything\\nshort of physical perfection is unacceptable. They\\nmay then develop distorted perceptions of their own\\nfaces and bodies.\\nA young person’s family of origin also has a power-\\nful influence on his or her vulnerability to BDD.\\nChildren whose parents are themselves obsessed with\\nappearance, dieting, and/or body building, or who are\\nKEY TERMS\\nBody image— A term that refers to a person s inner\\npicture of his or her outward appearance. It has\\ntwo components: perceptions of the appearance\\nof one’s body, and emotional responses to those\\nperceptions.\\nDelusion— A false belief that is resistant to reason\\nor contrary to actual fact. Common delusions\\ninclude delusions of persecution, delusions about\\none s importance (sometimes called delusions of\\ngrandeur), or delusions of being controlled by\\nothers. In BDD, the delusion is related to the\\npatient’s perception of his or her body.\\nDisplacement— A psychological process in which\\nfeelings originating from one source are expressed\\noutwardly in terms of concern or preoccupation\\nwith an issue or problem that the patient considers\\nmore acceptable. In some BDD patients, obsession\\nabout the body includes displaced feelings, often\\nrelated to a history of childhood abuse.\\nMuscle dysmorphia— A subtype of BDD, described\\nas excessive preoccupation with muscularity and\\nbody building to the point of interference with\\nsocial, educational, or occupational functioning.\\nSerotonin— A chemical produced by the brain that\\nfunctions as a neurotransmitter. Low serotonin\\nlevels are associated with mood disorders, particu-\\nlarly depression. Medications known as selective\\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used to\\ntreat BDD and other disorders characterized by\\ndepressed mood.\\nSomatoform disorders— A group of psychiatric dis-\\norders in the DSM-IV-TR classification that are\\ncharacterized by external physical symptoms or\\ncomplaints. BDD is classified as a somatoform\\ndisorder.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 597\\nBody dysmorphic disorder'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 627, 'page_label': '628'}, page_content='highly critical of their children’s looks, are at greater\\nrisk of developing BDD.\\nAn additional factor in some young people is a\\nhistory of childhood trauma orabuse. Buried feelings\\nabout the abuse or traumatic incident may emerge\\nin the form of obsession about a part of the face or\\nbody. This ‘‘reassignment’’ of emotions from the unac-\\nknowledged true cause to another issue is called dis-\\nplacement. For example, an adolescent who frequently\\nfelt overwhelmed in childhood by physically abusive\\nparents may develop a preoccupation at the high\\nschool level with muscular strength and power.\\nSymptoms\\nThe central symptom of BDD is excessive concern\\nwith a specific facial feature or body part. Research\\nindicates that the features most likely to be the focus of\\nthe patient’s attention are (in order of frequency) com-\\nplexion flaws (acne, blemishes, scars, wrinkles); hair\\n(on the head or the body, too much or too little); and\\nfacial features (size, shape, or lack of symmetry). The\\npatient’s concerns may, however, involve other body\\nparts, and may shift over time from one feature to\\nanother.\\nOther symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder\\ninclude:\\n/C15Ritualistic behavior. Ritualistic behavior refers to\\nactions that the patient performs to manageanxiety\\nand that take up excessive amounts of his or her time.\\nPatients are typically upset if someone or something\\ninterferes with or interrupts their ritual. Ritualistic\\nbehaviors in BDD may includeexercise or makeup\\nroutines, assuming specific poses or postures in front\\nof a mirror, etc.\\n/C15Camouflaging the ‘‘problem’’ feature or body part\\nwith makeup, hats, or clothing. Camouflaging\\nappears to be the single most common symptom\\namong patients with BDD; it is reported by 94%.\\n/C15Abnormal behavior around mirrors, car bumpers,\\nlarge windows, or similar reflecting surfaces. A\\nmajority of patients diagnosed with BDD frequently\\ncheck their appearance in mirrors or spend long\\nperiods of time doing so. A minority, however,\\nreact in the opposite fashion and avoid mirrors\\nwhenever possible.\\n/C15Frequent requests for reassurance from others about\\ntheir appearance.\\n/C15Frequently comparing one’s appearance to others.\\n/C15Avoiding activities outside the home, including\\nschool and social events.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of BDD in children or adolescents\\nis often made by physicians in family practice because\\nthey are more likely to have developed long-term rela-\\ntionships of trust with young people. At the adult\\nlevel, it is often specialists in dermatology,cosmetic\\ndentistry, or plastic surgery who may suspect that the\\npatient suffers from BDD because of frequent requests\\nfor repeated or unnecessary procedures. Reported\\nrates of BDD among dermatology andcosmetic sur-\\ngery patients range between 6 and 15 percent. The\\ndiagnosis is made on the basis of the patient’s history\\ntogether with the physician’s observations of the\\npatient’s overall mood and conversation patterns.\\nPeople with BDD often come across to others as gen-\\nerally anxious and worried. In addition, the patient’s\\ndress or clothing styles may suggest a diagnosis of\\nBDD. It is not unusual, however, for patients with\\nBDD to take offense if their primary care doctor\\nsuggests referral to a psychiatrist.\\nSome physicians may use a self-report question-\\nnaire, such as the Multidimensional Body-Self\\nRelations Questionnaire (MBSRQ) or the short form\\nof the Situational Inventory of Body-Image Dysphoria\\n(SIBID), to evaluate patients during an office visit.\\nThere are no brain imaging studies or laboratory\\ntests as of the early 2000s that can be used to diagnose\\nBDD.\\nTreatment\\nThe standard course of treatment for body dys-\\nmorphic disorder is a combination of medications and\\npsychotherapy. Surgical, dental, or dermatologic\\ntreatments have been found to be ineffective.\\nThe medications most frequently prescribed for\\npatients with BDD are theselective serotonin reuptake\\ninhibitors, most commonly fluoxetine (Prozac) or ser-\\ntraline (Zoloft). Other SSRIs that have been used with\\nthis group of patients include fluvoxamine (Luvox)\\nand paroxetine (Paxil). In fact, it is the relatively high\\nrate of positive responses to SSRIs among BDD\\npatients that led to the hypothesis that the disorder\\nhas a neurobiological component related to serotonin\\nlevels in the body. An associated finding is that\\npatients with BDD require higher dosages ofSSRI\\nmedications than patients who are being treated for\\ndepression with these drugs.\\nThe most effective approach to psychotherapy\\nwith BDD patients is cognitive-behavioral restructur-\\ning.

Boils occur most\\ncommonly on the face, back of the neck, buttocks,\\nupper legs and groin area, armpits, and upper torso.\\nCarbuncles are less common than single boils; they are\\nmost likely to form at the back of the neck. Males are\\nmore likely to develop carbuncles.\\nBoils and carbuncles are common problems in the\\ngeneral population, particularly among adolescents\\nand adults.

Although the surface of human\\nskin is usually resistant to bacterial infection,S. aureus\\nc a ne n t e rt h r o u g hab r e a ki nthe skin surface–including\\nbreaks caused by needle punctures for insulin or drug\\ninjections. Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy\\ncreams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are\\nmore vulnerable to infection.Bacterial skin infections\\ncan be spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close\\nhuman contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or\\ncarbuncle.\\nAs the infection develops, an area of inflamed tis-\\nsue gradually forms a pus-filled swelling or pimple that\\nis painful to touch. As the boil matures, it forms a\\nyellowish head or point. It may either continue to\\nswell until the point bursts open and allows the pus to\\ndrain, or it may be gradually reabsorbed into the skin.\\nIt takes between one and two weeks for a boil to heal\\ncompletely after it comes to a head and discharges\\npus. The bacteria that cause the boil can spread into\\nother areas of the skin or even into the bloodstream\\nif the skin around the boil is injured by squeezing. If the\\ninfection spreads, the patient will usually develop chills\\nand fever, swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenitis), and red\\nlines in the skin running outward from the boil.\\nFurunculosis is a word that is sometimes used\\nto refer to recurrent boils. Many patients have\\nrepeated episodes of furunculosis that are difficult to\\ntreat because their nasal passages carry colonies of\\nS. aureus. These bacterial colonies make it easy for\\nthe patient’s skin to be reinfected. They are most likely\\nto develop in patients with diabetes, HIV infection, or\\nother immune system disorders.\\nCarbuncles are formed when the bacteria infect\\nseveral hair follicles that are close together.\\nCarbunculosis is a word that is sometimes used to\\nrefer to the development of carbuncles.

Patients with carbuncles may also have a low-\\ngrade fever or feel generally unwell.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of boils and carbuncles is usually\\nmade by the patient’s primary care doctor on the basis\\nof visual examination of the skin.

Patients need to\\nbe warned against picking at or squeezing boils\\nbecause of the danger of spreading the infection into\\nother parts of the skin or bloodstream. It is especially\\nimportant to avoid squeezing boils around the mouth\\nor nose because infections in these areas can be carried\\nto the brain. Patients should also be advised about\\nkeeping the skin clean, washing their hands carefully\\nbefore and after touching the boil or carbuncle, avoid-\\ning the use of greasy cosmetics or creams, and keeping\\ntheir towels and washcloths separate from those of\\nother family members. Some doctors may recommend\\nan antiseptic soap or gel for washing the infected\\nareas.\\nIf the patient has had several episodes of furuncu-\\nlosis, the doctor may examine family members or close\\ncontacts to see if they are carriers ofS. aureus. In many\\ncases they also need treatment for boils or carbuncles.\\nSkin infections and reinfections involving small\\ngroups or clusters of people are being reported more\\nfrequently in the United States.\\nMedications\\nBoils are usually treated with application of antibio-\\ntic creams–usually clindamycin or polymyxin–following\\nthe application of hot compresses. The compresses help\\nthe infection to come to a head and drain.\\nCarbuncles and furunculosis are usually treated\\nwith oral antibiotics as well as antibiotic creams or\\nointments. The specific medications that are given\\nare usually dicloxacillin (Dynapen) or cephalexin\\n(Keflex). Erythromycin may be given to patients who\\nare allergic to penicillin. The usual course of oral anti-\\nbiotics is 5-10 days; however, patients with recurrent\\nfurunculosis may be given oral antibiotics for longer\\nperiods. Furunculosis is treated with a combination of\\ndicloxacillin and rifampin (Rifadin).\\nPatients with bacterial colonies in their nasal pas-\\nsages are often given mupirocin (Bactroban) to apply\\ndirectly to the lining of the nose.\\nSurgical treatment\\nBoils and carbuncles that are very large, or that\\nare not draining, may be opened with a sterile needle\\nor surgical knife to allow the pus to drain.

As many as\\none-fourth of women who fracture their hip after age\\n50 die within one year.\\nMost people today will get a bone density scan\\nfrom a machine using a technology called Dual Energy\\nX-ray Absorptiometry or DEXA for short. This\\nmachine takes a picture of the bones in the spine,\\nhip, total body and wrist, and calculates their density.\\nIf a DEXA machine is not available, bone density\\nscans can also be done with dual photon absorptiome-\\ntry (measuring the spine, hip and total body) and\\nquantitativecomputed tomography scans (measuring\\nthe spine). Bone density scanners that use DEXA tech-\\nnology to just measure bone density in the wrist (called\\npDEXA scans) provide scans at some drugstores.

These low-dose x rays form a\\nfan beam that rotates around the patient. During the\\ntest, the scanner moves to capture images of the\\npatient’s spine, hip or entire body.

They also are used\\nprescribed for Paget’s disease, a painful condition that\\nweakens and deforms bones, and they are used to\\ncontrol calcium levels in the blood.\\nBone is living tissue. Like other tissue, bone is\\nconstantly being broken down and replaced with new\\nmaterial. Normally, there is a balance between the\\nbreakdown of old bone and its replacement with new\\nbone. But when something goes wrong with the\\nprocess, bone disorders may result.\\nOsteoporosis is a particular concern for women\\nafter menopause, as well as for older men.

Over time, this condition weakens the bones\\nand makes them more likely to break. Osteoporosis\\nis four times more common in women than in men.\\nThis is because women have less bone mass than men,\\ntend to live longer and take in less calcium, and need\\nthe female hormone estrogen to keep their bones\\nstrong. If men live long enough, they are also at risk\\nof getting osteoporosis later in life. Once total bone\\nmass has peaked–around age 35–all adults start to lose\\nit. In women, the rate of bone loss speeds up during\\nmenopause, when estrogen levels fall. Bone loss may\\nalso occur if both ovaries are removed by surgery.\\nOvaries make estrogen.Hormone replacement therapy\\nis one approach to preventing osteoporosis. However,\\nnot all people can use hormone replacement therapy.\\nBone disorder drugs are a good alternative for people\\nwho already have osteoporosis or who are at risk\\nof developing it. Risk factors include lack of regular\\nexercise, early menopause, being underweight, and a\\nstrong family history of osteoporosis.\\nDescription\\nBone disorder drugs are available only with a physi-\\ncian’s prescription and come in tablet, nasal spray, and\\ninjectable forms. Commonly used bone disorder drugs\\nare alendronate (Fosamax), calcitonin (Miacalcin,\\nCalcimar), and raloxifene (Evista). Raloxifene belongs\\nto a group of drugs known as selective estrogen recep-\\ntor modulators (SERMs), which act like estrogen in\\nsome parts of the body but not in others. This makes\\nthe drugs less likely to cause some of the harmful\\neffects that estrogen may cause. Unlike estrogen,\\nraloxifene does not increase the risk ofbreast cancer.\\nIn fact, research suggests that raloxifene may even\\nreduce that risk.\\nRecommended dosage\\nAlendronate\\nFOR OSTEOPOROSIS. The usual dose is 10 mg once\\na day. Treatment usually continues over many years.\\nFOR PAGET’S DISEASE. The usual dose is 40 mg\\nonce a day for six months.\\nThis medicine works only when it is taken with a\\nfull glass of water first thing in the morning, at least 30\\nminutes before eating or drinking anything or taking\\nany other medicine. Do not lie down for at least 30\\nminutes after taking it because the drug can irritate the\\nesophagus, the tube that delivers food form the mouth\\nto the stomach.\\nCalcitonin\\nNASAL SPRAY. The usual dose is one spray into the\\nnose once a day. Alternate nostrils, spraying the right\\nnostril one day, the left nostril the next day, and so on.\\nINJECTABLE. The recommended dosage depends\\non the condition for which the medicine is prescribed\\nand may be different for different people. Check with\\nthe physician who prescribed the medicine or the\\npharmacist who filled the prescription for the proper\\ndosage.\\nRaloxifene\\nThe usual dose is one 60-mg tablet daily.\\nPrecautions\\nAldendronate\\nPeople with low levels of calcium in their blood\\nshould not take this medicine. It also is not recom-\\nmended for women on hormone replacement therapy\\nor for anyone with kidney problems. Before using\\nalendronate, anyone who has digestive or swallowing\\nproblems should make sure that his or her physician\\nknows about the condition.\\nCalcitonin\\nCalcitonin nasal spray may cause irritation or\\nsmall sores in the nose.

Within and around this matrix are\\nlocated the cells of the bones, which are of four types.\\nOsteoblasts produce the bone matrix. Osteocytes\\nare mature osteoblasts and serve to maintain the\\nbone. Osteoclasts break down and remove bone tis-\\nsue. Bone lining cells cover bone surfaces. Together,\\nthese four types of cells are responsible for building\\nthe bone matrix, maintaining it, and remodeling the\\nbone as needed.\\nThere are three ways in which a bone graft can\\nhelp repair a defect. The first is called osteogenesis, the\\nformation of new bone by the cells contained within\\nthe graft. The second is osteoinduction, a chemical\\nprocess in which molecules contained within the graft\\n(bone morphogenetic proteins) convert the patient’s\\ncells into cells that are capable of forming bone. The\\nthird is osteoconduction, a physical effect by which the\\nmatrix of the graft forms a scaffold on which cells in\\nthe recipient are able to form new bone.\\nNew bone for grafting can be obtained from other\\nbones in the patient’s own body (e.g., hip bones or\\nribs), called autograft, or from bone taken from other\\npeople that is frozen and stored in tissue banks, called\\nallograft. A variety of natural and synthetic replace-\\nment materials are also used instead of bone, including\\ncollagen (the protein substance of the white fibers of\\nthe skin, bone, and connective tissues); polymers, such\\nas silicone and some acrylics; hydroxyapatite; calcium\\nsulfate; and ceramics. A new material, called resorbable\\npolymeric grafts, is also being studied. These resorb-\\nable grafts provide a structure for new bone to grow\\non; the grafts then slowly dissolve, leaving only the\\nnew bone behind.\\nTo place the graft, the surgeon makes an incision\\nin the skin over the bone defect and shapes the bone\\ngraft or replacement material to fit into the defect.\\nAfter the graft is placed into the defect, it is held in\\nplace with pins, plates, or screws. The incision is closed\\nwith stitches and a splint or cast is used to prevent\\nmovement of the bones while healing.\\nThe costs associated with a bone graft vary. These\\ncosts include: the surgeon’s fee (variable); anesthesiol-\\nogist’s fees (averaging $350 to $400 per hour); hospital\\ncharges (averaging $1,500 to $1,800 per day, more for\\nintensive care or private rooms); medication charges\\n($200 to $400); and additional charges, including an\\nassisting surgeon, treatment of complications, diag-\\nnostic procedures (e.g., blood work or x rays), medical\\nsupplies, and equipment use. The cost for the graft\\nitself can range from $250 to $900.\\nThis procedure is covered by many third-party\\ninsurers; insurance coverage should be explored for\\neach individual case.\\nAftercare\\nThe time required for convalescence for fractures\\nor spinal fusion may vary from one to 10 days, and\\nvigorousexercise may be limited for up to three\\nmonths.\\nMost bone grafts are successful in helping the\\nbone defect to heal. The extent of recovery will depend\\non the size of the defect and the condition of the bone\\nsurrounding the graft at the time of surgery. Severe\\ndefects may take some time to heal and may require\\nfurther attention after the initial graft. In one study of\\nover 1,000 patients who received very large allografts\\nafter surgery for bone cancer, researchers found that\\napproximately 85% of the patients were able to return\\nto work or normal physical activities without using\\ncrutches. However, about 25% of these patients\\nrequired a second operation, because the first did not\\nheal properly.

This condition is called\\nfracture nonunion, and it occurs more frequently\\namong adults than children, in people with severe or\\ncomplex fractures, and in people who smoke.\\nThe theory behind applying an electric current to\\nfractures to stimulate healing is based on the fact that\\nthe concave side of the bone becomes negatively\\ncharged and the convex side is positively charged. It\\nis believed that artificially encouraging this charging\\nwith an electric current will speed healing. In 1996, the\\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved\\nthe application of low intensity ultrasound pulses as a\\ntreatment for fracture nonunion.\\nUltrasound and electromagnetic stimulation are\\nexpensive and are used only when healing problems\\nexist for a substantial length of time. Each method\\nmust be used for at least three to six months to be\\neffective.\\nPrecautions\\nBone growth stimulation cannot be used if the gap\\nbetween the ends of the fracture is too large.\\nDescription\\nElectric stimulation can be applied either from the\\ninside of the body (invasively) or from the outside the\\nbody (noninvasively). Ultrasound is a noninvasive\\nprocedure. The type of stimulation selected depends\\non the doctor’s preference, the type and location of the\\nfracture, and the patient’s motivation to comply with\\nthe treatment schedule. Treatment can take anywhere\\nfrom three to six months.\\nInvasive stimulators\\nInvasive electric stimulators are either fully or\\npartially implantable. The advantage of these devices\\nis that they apply a direct electric current to the frac-\\nture 24 hours a day. The fully implantable stimulator\\nrequires little daily attention from the patient. Patients\\nusing a semi-implanted stimulator must regulate their\\nown treatment schedule and have to care for the exter-\\nnal power pack. The disadvantage of implantable and\\nsemi-implantable stimulators is that their implanta-\\ntion is a surgical procedure.\\nFully implantable direct current stimulators are\\ninstalled in a hospital under general or regional\\nanesthesia. Both the stimulator and the power source\\nare implanted. The surgeon makes an incision and\\nplaces a spiral shaped cathode inside the bone. A\\nwire leads to the power source and a small anode.\\nThe power source is a battery pack that is implanted\\nin the nearby muscle.

The incision is then closed.\\nOnce in place, the device provides continuous direct\\nelectric current for bone growth stimulation.\\nPartially implanted stimulators use cathode pins\\nthat are implanted at the edge of each bone that is\\nfractured.

This source of stimulation also\\nruns continuously.\\nNoninvasive stimulators\\nIn the noninvasive stimulator, external electro-\\nmagnetic coils are placed on either side of the fracture\\nand are held in place by a strap or cuff. Locating the\\ncoils correctly is important, and their location relative\\nto the fracture is usually confirmed by x rays.\\nThe coils produce a pulsating electromagnetic\\nfield. It is up to the patient to maintain the prescribed\\ntreatment schedule. Effective treatment requires sti-\\nmulation anywhere from three to ten hours each day\\nin periods of no less than one hour.\\nUltrasound stimulation is the most recent treat-\\nment for stimulating bone growth. A device that gen-\\nerates low intensity pulses of sound is applied to the\\nskin over the fracture. The advantage of this technique\\nis that it is noninvasive and the period of application of\\nthe sound pulses can be as short as 20-30 minutes each\\nday. The results of this treatment have been studied\\nless than the effect of electromagnetic stimulation.\\nPreparation\\nBone growth stimulation is done only when heal-\\ning has failed to occur for many months. Before it is\\nstarted, x rays are done of the fracture area. If the\\ndevice is to be implanted, standard preoperative\\nblood and urine tests are done. The patient may meet\\nwith an anesthesiologist to discuss any conditions that\\nmight affect the administration of anesthesia.\\nAftercare\\nIf a noninvasive, pulsating, electromagnetic field\\ndevice is used, the patient must not put anystress or\\nweight on the fracture until it is healed, which is a\\nmatter of months in most cases. In all lower limb\\nfractures, regardless of the stimulation method used,\\nthe patient can not bear weight on the limb with the\\nfracture until healing is complete. This limits the\\npatient’s mobility for many months. Patients have\\nthe responsibility for regularly making sure that the\\nunit works and caring for external devices and the\\ncasts that hold them in place.\\nRisks\\nNoninvasive devices have few risks associated\\nwith them. The main risk associated with implantable\\ndevices is the development of infection at the site of\\nimplantation.\\nNormal results\\nSuccess in healing a fracture nonunion using bone\\ngrowth stimulation depends on the type, location, and\\nseverity of the fracture and the age and general health\\nof the patient.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nMayo Clinic. ‘‘Fractures - Treatment Methods are Tailored\\nto the Break.’’Mayo Clinic Health Letter14, no. 4\\n(April 1996): 1-3.\\nTish Davidson, A.M.\\nBone infection see Osteomyelitis\\nBone marrow aspiration and\\nbiopsy\\nDefinition\\nBone marrow aspiration, also called bone marrow\\nsampling, is the removal by suction of fluid from the\\nsoft, spongy material that lines the inside of most\\nbones.

On rare occasions, a long\\nbone of the leg (tibia) may be used as a sample site\\nfor an infant.\\nIn a bone marrow aspiration, a special needle is\\ninserted beneath the skin and rotated until it pene-\\ntrates the cortex, or outer covering of the bone. At\\nleast half a teaspoon of marrow is withdrawn from\\nthe bone by a syringe attached to the needle. The\\npatient may experience discomfort when the needle\\nis inserted or when the marrow is aspirated. If more\\nmarrow is needed, the needle is repositioned slightly,\\na new syringe is attached, and a second sample is\\ntaken. The samples are transferred from the syringes\\nto slides and vials, then sent to a laboratory for\\nanalysis.\\nBone marrow biopsy may be performed immedi-\\nately before or after bone marrow aspiration. The\\nprocedure utilizes a special large-bore needle that is\\nused to drill out a core of marrow. In bone marrow\\nbiopsy, the needle is inserted, rotated from side to side,\\nwithdrawn, and reinserted at a different angle. This\\nprocedure is repeated if needed until a small core,\\nabout 0.4 inches (1 cm) long, is separated from the\\nbone marrow. The needle is again removed, and a\\npiece of fine wire threaded through its tip transfers\\nthe specimen onto sterile gauze. The patient may feel\\ndiscomfort or pressure when the needle is inserted and\\nexperience a brief, pulling sensation when the marrow\\nis withdrawn. Unlike aspiration specimens, which are\\nsmeared, these samples contain structurally intact\\nbone marrow. Microscopic examination can show\\nwhat material its cells contain and how they are alike\\nor different from one another. The bone may either be\\nembedded intact in paraffin (a type of wax), or be\\ndecalcified (a process which takes place overnight)\\nfor a different type of staining and examination.\\nEach type of preparation has certain advantages.\\nPreparation\\nA current history and physical are obtained from\\nthe patient, along with proper consent. The patient is\\ngenerally placed in a prone position (lying face down)\\nfor preparation, and local anesthetic, with or without\\nsedation, is administered.\\nAftercare\\nAfter the needle is removed, the biopsy site will be\\ncovered with a clean, dry bandage. Pressure is applied\\nto control bleeding. The patient’s pulse, breathing,\\nblood pressure, and temperature are monitored until\\nthey return to normal, and the patient may be\\ninstructed to remain in a supine position (lying face\\nup) for half an hour before getting dressed.\\nThe patient should be able to leave the clinic and\\nresume normal activities immediately. Patients who\\nhave received a sedative often feel sleepy for the rest\\nof the day; driving, cooking, and other activities that\\nrequire clear thinking and quick reactions should\\ntherefore be avoided.\\nThe biopsy site should be kept covered and dry\\nfor several hours.

Bone marrow transplants are debilitating. A\\nperson’s ability to withstand the rigors of the transplant\\nis a key consideration in deciding to use this treatment.\\nDescription\\nAutologous and allogeneic transplants\\nTwo important requirements for a bone marrow\\ntransplant are the donor and the recipient. Sometimes,\\nthe donor and the recipient may be the same person.\\nThis type of transplant is called an autologous\\ntransplant. It is typically used in cases in which a\\nperson’s bone marrow is generally healthy but will be\\ndestroyed due to medical treatment for diseases such\\nasbreast cancer and Hodgkin’s disease. Most bone\\nmarrow transplants are autologous. If a person’s\\nbone marrow is unsuitable for an autologous trans-\\nplant, the bone marrow must be derived from another\\nperson in an allogeneic transplant.\\nAllogeneic transplants are more complicated\\nbecause of proteins called human lymphocyte antigens\\n(HLA) that are on the surface of bone marrow cells. If\\nthe donor and the recipient have very dissimilar anti-\\ngens, the recipient’s immune system regards the\\ndonor’s bone marrow cells as invaders and launches\\na destructive attack against them. Such an attack\\nnegates any benefits offered by the transplant.\\nHLA matching\\nThere are only five major HLA classes or types—\\ndesignated HLA–A,–B, –C,–D, and class III—but\\nmuch variation within the groupings. For example,\\nHLA–A from one individual may be similar to, but\\nnot the same as, HLA–A in another individual; such a\\nsituation can render a transplant from one to the other\\nimpossible.\\nHLA matching is more likely if the donor and\\nrecipient are related, particularly if they are siblings;\\nhowever, an unrelated donor may be a potential\\nmatch. Only in rare cases is matching HLA types\\nbetween two people not an issue: if the recipient has an\\nidentical twin. Identical twins carry the same genes;\\ntherefore, the same antigens.

Peripheral\\nblood stem cells (PBSCs) are obtained from circu-\\nlating blood rather than from bone marrow, but\\nthe amount of stem cells found in the peripheral\\nblood is much smaller than the amount of stem\\ncells found in the bone marrow. Peripheral blood\\nstem cells can be used in either autologous or\\nallogeneic transplants. The majority of PBSC\\ntransplants are autologous. However, recent clini-\\ncal studies indicate that PBSCs are being used\\nmore frequently than bone marrow for allogeneic\\nbone marrow transplantation.\\nThe advantages of PBSC transplants when com-\\npared to bone marrow transplants are: in allogeneic\\ntransplantation, haematopoietic and immune recov-\\nery are faster with PBSCs which reduces the potential\\nfor disease recurrence, primarily graft-versus-host-\\ndisease. In autologous transplantation, the use of\\nPBSCs can result in fasterblood count recoveries.\\nAlso, some medical conditions exist in which the reci-\\npient cannot accept bone marrow stem cell transplants,\\nbut can accept PBSC transplants. Some possible dis-\\nadvantages to PBSC transplant versus bone marrow\\ntransplantation are: so much more fluid volume is\\nnecessary to collect enough PBSCs that, at the time of\\ninfusing the new stem cells into the recipient, the fluid\\ncan collect in the lungs or cause temporary kidney\\nproblems. Also, the time commitment for the donor\\nfor a PBSC transplant is considerable. When the\\nPBSCs are being collected, several outpatient sessions\\nare needed and each session lasts approximately two–\\nfour hours.\\nThe transplant procedure\\nBONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION. The bone\\nmarrow extraction, or harvest, is the same whether\\nfor an autologous or allogeneic transplant.\\nHarvesting is done undergeneral anesthesia (i.e., the\\ndonor sleeps through the procedure), and discomfort\\nis usually minimal afterwards. Bone marrow is drawn\\nfrom the iliac crest (the part of the hip bone to either\\nside of the lower back) with a special needle and a\\nsyringe. Several punctures are usually necessary to\\ncollect the needed amount of bone marrow, approxi-\\nmately 1–2 quarts (0.9–1.91). (This amount is only a\\nsmall percentage of the total bone marrow and is\\ntypically replaced within four weeks.) The donor\\nremains at the hospital for 24–48 hours and can\\nresume normal activities within a few days.\\nIf the bone marrow is meant for an autologous\\ntransplant, it is stored at -112 to -320 /C14F (-80 to\\n-196 /C14C) until it is needed. Bone marrow for an allo-\\ngeneic transplant is sometimes treated to remove the\\ndonor’s T cells (a type of white blood cell) or to remove\\nABO (blood type) antigens; otherwise, it is trans-\\nplanted without modification.\\nThe bone marrow is administered to the recipient\\nvia a catheter (a narrow, flexible tube) inserted into a\\nlarge vein in the chest. From the bloodstream, it\\nmigrates to the cavities within the bones where bone\\nmarrow is normally stored. If the transplant is success-\\nful, the bone marrow begins to produce normal blood\\ncells once it is in place, or engrafted.\\nPERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLAN-\\nTATION. Before collection for a PBSC transplant,\\ndonors receive daily four injections of the drug\\nG-CSF, or filgrastim. (Patients can give it to them-\\nselves at home if need be.) These pretreatments stimu-\\nlate the body to release stem cells into the blood. After\\nthese pretreatments, the donors’ experience is similar\\nto that of a whole blood donor’s experience— PBSC\\ndonors’ blood is collected at a clinic or hospital as an\\noutpatient procedure. The differences are that several\\nsessions will be needed over days or weeks and the\\nblood is collected in a process called apheresis. The\\nblood travels from one arm into a blood cell separator\\nthat removes only the stem cells, and the rest of the\\nblood is returned back to the donor, in the other arm.\\nThe cells are then frozen for later use.\\nThe PBSCs are administered to the recipient using\\nthe same methods as those used in bone marrow trans-\\nplantation. As stated, the amount of fluid with PBSCs\\ninfused into the recipient’s body can be an issue.\\nCosts\\nBone marrow transplantation is an expensive pro-\\ncedure. (Bone marrow donors are volunteers and do\\nnot pay for any part of the procedure.) Insurance\\ncompanies and health maintenance organizations\\n(HMOs) may not cover the costs.\\nPreparation\\nA bone marrow transplant recipient can expect to\\nspend four to eight weeks in the hospital. In preparation\\nfor receiving the transplant, the recipient undergoes\\n‘‘conditioning’’—a preparative regimen in which the\\nbone marrow and abnormal cells are destroyed.\\nConditioning rids the body of diseased cells and\\nmakes room for the marrow to be transplanted.

A\\nradioactive substance is injected intravenously, and\\nthe image of its distribution in the skeletal system is\\nanalyzed to detect certain diseases or conditions.\\nPurpose\\nBone scans are most frequently ordered to check\\nwhether acancer that originated elsewhere has spread\\nto the bones. Cancers that begin in the breasts,\\nkidneys, lungs, prostate, thyroid, or urinary bladder\\nare most likely to spread, or metastasize, to the bones.\\nIf metastases are found, periodic bone scans may be\\nordered to see if therapy is effective against a cancer.\\nSome cancers arise in bone. These are called pri-\\nmary bone cancers. When an abnormality is found on\\nan x ray of a bone, a bone scan may be helpful in\\ndeciding if it is a primary bone cancer, or a non-can-\\ncerous (benign) condition.\\nInfection in the bone ( osteomyelitis)c a nb e\\ndetected or confirmed by a bone scan, often days or\\nweeks before an x ray would reveal it. Bone scans are\\nuseful in diagnosing early arthritic changes, and mon-\\nitoring both the progression of the disease and the\\neffectiveness of treatment. Unexplainedpain may be\\nevaluated with a bone scan, because it can demon-\\nstrate fractures that are difficult to detect on x ray.\\nBone scans can be used to see if artificial joints have\\nloosened or become infected.

In bone x rays, electrical current passes\\nthrough an x-ray tube and produces a beam of ionizing\\nradiation that passes through the bone(s) being exam-\\nined.

Odle\\nBotulism\\nDefinition\\nBotulism is caused by botulinum toxin, a natural\\npoison produced by certain bacteria in theClostridium\\ngenus. Exposure to the botulinum toxin occurs mostly\\nfrom eating contaminated food, or in infants, from\\ncertain clostridia growing in the intestine. Botulinum\\ntoxin blocks motor nerves’ ability to release acetylcho-\\nline, the neurotransmitter that relays nerve signals to\\nmuscles, and flaccidparalysis occurs. As botulism\\nprogresses, the muscles that control the airway and\\nbreathing fail.\\nDescription\\nBotulism occurs rarely, but it causes concern\\nbecause of its high fatality rate. Clinical descriptions\\nof botulism possibly reach as far back in history as\\nancient Rome and Greece. However, the relationship\\nbetween contaminated food and botulism wasn’t\\ndefined until the late 1700s. In 1793 the German physi-\\ncian, Justinius Kerner, deduced that a substance in\\nspoiled sausages, which he calledwurstgift (German\\nfor sausage poison), caused botulism. The toxin’s origin\\nand identity remained elusive until Emile von\\nErmengem, a Belgian professor, isolatedClostridium\\nbotulinumin 1895 and identified it as the poison source.\\nThree types of botulism have been identified: food-\\nborne, wound, and infant botulism. The main differ-\\nence between types hinges on the route of exposure to\\nthe toxin. In the United States, there are approximately\\n110 cases of botulism reported annually. Food-borne\\nbotulism accounts for 25% of all botulism cases and\\nusually can be traced to eating contaminated home-\\npreserved food. Infant botulism accounts for 72% of\\nall cases, but the recovery rate is good (about 98%)\\nwith proper treatment. From 1990 to 2000, 263 cases of\\nfood-borne cases were reported in the United States,\\nmost of them in Alaska. Though most were related to\\nhome canning, two restaurant-associated outbreaks\\naffected 25 people.\\nThough domestic food poisoning is a problem\\nworld-wide, there has been a growing concern regard-\\ning the use of botulism toxin in biological warfare and\\nterrorist acts. The Iraqi government admitted in 1995\\nthat it had loaded 11,200 liters of botulinum toxin into\\nSCUD missiles during the Gulf War. Luckily, these\\nspecial missiles were never used. As of 1999, there\\nwere 17 countries known to be developing biological\\nweapons, including the culture of botulism toxins.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nToxin produced by the bacteriumClostridium botu-\\nlinum is the main culprit in botulism. Other members of\\nthe clostridium genus can produce botulinum toxin,\\nnamely C. argentinense, C. butyricum,a n dC. baratii,\\nbut they are minor sources. To grow, these bacteria\\nrequire a low-acid, oxygen-free environment that is\\nwarm (40-120/C14F or 4.4–48.8/C14C) and moist. Lacking\\nthese conditions, the bacteriatransform themselves into\\nspores that, like plant seeds, can remain dormant for\\nyears. Clostridia and their spores exist all over the world,\\nespecially in soil and aquatic sediments. They do not\\nthreaten human or animal health until the spores\\nencounter an environment that favors growth. The\\nspores then germinate, and the growing bacteria produce\\nthe deadly botulism toxin.\\nScientists have discovered that clostridia can pro-\\nduce at least seven types of botulism toxin, identified\\nas A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Humans are usually\\naffected by A, B, E, and very rarely F. Domesticated\\nanimals such as dogs, cattle, and mink are affected by\\nbotulism C toxin, which also affects birds and has\\ncaused massive die-offs in domestic bird flocks and\\nwild waterfowl. Botulism D toxin can cause illness in\\ncattle, and horses succumb to botulism A, B, and C\\ntoxin. There have been no confirmed human or animal\\nbotulism cases linked to the G toxin.\\nIn humans, botulinum toxin latches onto specific\\nproteins in nerve endings and irreversibly destroys\\nthem. These proteins control the release of acetylcholine,\\na neurotransmitter that stimulates muscle cells. With\\nacetylcholine release blocked, nerves are not able to sti-\\nmulate muscles. Ironically, botulinum toxin has found a\\nbeneficial niche in the world of medicine due to this\\n624 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBotulism'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 654, 'page_label': '655'}, page_content='action. Certain medical disorders are characterized by\\ninvoluntary and uncontrollable muscle contractions.\\nMedical researchers have discovered that injecting a\\nstrictly controlled dose of botulinum toxin into affected\\nmuscles inhibits excessive muscle contractions. The\\nmuscle is partially paralyzed and normal movement is\\nretained. This is commonly referred to as Botox injection.\\nThe three types of human botulism include the\\nfollowing symptoms:\\n/C15Food-borne. Food that has been improperly preser-\\nved or stored can harbor botulinum toxin-producing\\nclostridia. Botulism symptoms typically appear within\\n18-36 hours of eating contaminated food, with\\nextremes of four hours to eight days. Initial symptoms\\ninclude blurred or double vision and difficulty swallow-\\ning and speaking. Possible gastrointestinal problems\\nincludeconstipation, nausea,a n dvomiting. As botulism\\nprogresses, the victim experiences weakness or paraly-\\nsis, starting with the head muscles and progressing\\ndown the body. Breathing becomes increasingly diffi-\\ncult. Without medical care,respiratory failureanddeath\\nare very likely.\\n/C15Infant. Infant botulism was first described in 1976.\\nUnlike adults, infants younger than 12 months are\\nvulnerable toC. botulinum colonizing the intestine.\\nInfants ingest spores in honey or simply by swallow-\\ning spore-containing dust. The spores germinate in\\nthe large intestine and, as the bacteria grow, they\\nproduce botulinum toxin that is absorbed into the\\ninfant’s body. The first symptoms include constipa-\\ntion, lethargy, and poor feeding. As infant botulism\\nprogresses, sucking and swallowing (thus eating)\\nbecome difficult. A nursing mother will often notice\\nbreast engorgement as the first sign of her infant’s\\nillness. The baby suffers overall weakness and cannot\\ncontrol head movements. Because of the flaccid\\nparalysis of the muscles, the baby appears ‘‘floppy.’’\\nBreathing is impaired, and death from respiratory\\nfailure is a very real danger.\\n/C15Wound. Confirmed cases of wound botulism have\\nbeen linked to trauma such as severe crush injuries to\\nthe extremities, surgery, and illegal drug use. Wound\\nbotulism occurs when clostridia colonize an infected\\nwound and produce botulinum toxin. The symptoms\\nusually appear four to 18 days after an injury occurs\\nand are similar to food-borne botulism, although\\ngastrointestinal symptoms may be absent.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of botulism can be tricky because symp-\\ntoms mimic those presented by other diseases. Botulism\\nmay be confused with Guillain-Barre syndrome,\\nmyasthenia gravis, drug reactions,stroke, or nervous\\nsystem infection, intoxications (e.g. carbon monoxide\\nor atropine), orshellfish poisoning.

Laboratory tests are\\nused for definitive diagnosis, but if botulism seems\\nlikely, treatment starts immediately.\\nWhile waiting for laboratory results, doctors ask\\nabout recently consumed food and work to dismiss\\nother disease possibilities. Aphysical examination is\\ndone with an emphasis on the nervous system. As part\\nof this examination, CT scans, MRIs, electromyo-\\ngraphic tests, or lumbar punctures may be ordered.\\nLaboratory tests involve testing a suspected food and/\\nor the patient’s serum, feces, or other specimens for\\ntraces of botulinum toxin or clostridia.\\nTreatment\\nDrugs\\nAdults with botulism are treated with an antitoxin\\nderived from horse serum that is distributed by the\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. The anti-\\ntoxin (effective against toxin types A, B, and E) inac-\\ntivates only the botulinum toxin that is unattached to\\nnerve endings. Early injection of antitoxin (usually\\nwithin 24 hours of onset of symptoms) can preserve\\nnerve endings, prevent progression of the disease, and\\nreduce mortality.\\nInfants, however, cannot receive the antitoxin\\nused for adults. For them, human botulism immune\\nglobulin (BIG) is available in the United States\\nthrough the Infant Botulism Treatment and\\nPrevention Program in Berkeley, California. BIG neu-\\ntralizes toxin types A, B, C, D, and E before they can\\nbind to nerves. This antitoxin can provide protection\\nagainst A and B toxins for approximately four\\nmonths. Though many infants recover with suppor-\\ntive care, BIG cuts hospital stay in half, and therefore\\nreduces hospital costs by 50% as well.\\nAside from antitoxin, no drugs are used to treat\\nbotulism. Antibiotics are not effective for preventing\\nor treating botulism. In fact, antibiotic use is discour-\\naged for infants because dying bacteria could poten-\\ntially release more toxin into a baby’s system.\\nAntibiotics can be used, however, to treat secondary\\nrespiratory tract and other infections.\\nRespiratory support\\nTreatment for infants usually involves intensive\\nrespiratory support and tube feeding for weeks or\\neven months. Once an infant can breathe unaided,\\nphysical therapy is initiated to help the child relearn\\nhow to suck and swallow. A respirator is often required\\nto help adult patients breathe, and a tracheostomy may\\nalso be necessary.\\nSurgery\\nSurgery may be necessary to clean an infected\\nwound and remove the source of the bacteria that is\\nproducing the toxin. Antimicrobial therapy may be\\nnecessary.\\nGastric lavage\\nWhen botulism is caused by food, it often is neces-\\nsary to flush the gastrointestinal tract (gastric lavage).\\nOften cathartic agents orenemas are used. It is impor-\\ntant to avoid products that contain magnesium,\\nsince magnesium enhances the effect of the toxin.\\nPrognosis\\nWith medical intervention, botulism victims can\\nrecover completely, though slowly. It takes weeks to\\nmonths to recover from botulism, and severe cases\\ncan take years before a total recovery is attained.\\nRecovery depends on the nerve endings building\\nnew proteins to replace those destroyed by botulinum\\ntoxin.\\nPrevention\\nVaccines against botulism do not exist to pre-\\nvent infant botulism or other forms of the disease.\\nHowever, scientists announced in 2004 that they\\nhad successfully vaccinated mice and ducks against\\ntype C and D, which may help lead to vaccines for\\nhumans. Food safety is the surest prevention for botu-\\nlism. Botulinum toxin cannot be seen, smelled, or\\ntasted, so the wisest course is to discard any food that\\nseems spoiledwithout tasting it. Home canners must be\\ndiligent about using sterile equipment and following\\nU.S. Department of Agriculture canning guidelines. If\\nany part of a canned food container is rusty or bulging,\\nthe food should not be eaten. Infant botulism is diffi-\\ncult to prevent, because controlling what goes into an\\ninfant’s mouth is often beyond control, especially in\\nregard to spores in the air. One concrete preventive is\\nto never feed honey to infants younger than 12 months\\nsince it is one known source of botulism spores. As\\ninfants begin eating solid foods, the same food precau-\\ntions should be followed as for adults.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nCadou, Stephanie G. ‘‘Diagnosing Infant Botulism.’’The\\nNurse Practitioner26, no.3 (March 2001): 76.\\nShapiro, Roger L. and David L.

Bowel prepara-\\ntion is a cleansing of the intestines from fecal matter and\\nsecretions.\\nPurpose\\nThe ultimate goal of bowel preparation is to empty\\nand cleanse the bowel for a diagnostic procedure (using\\nx rays to detect a disease process in the intestines) or for\\nsurgical intervention (such as removal of polyps,cancer,\\nor narrowing of the intestinal diameter).Colonoscopyis\\nan effective treatment procedure for polyps (a growing\\nmass of tissue). This procedure enables the doctor to\\nvisualize the entire large bowel. During a colonoscopy,\\npolyps can be cauterized (applying an electric current\\nwhich incinerates the polyp). The procedure can be both\\ndiagnostic and therapeutic. Asigmoidoscopy scope is a\\nflexible tube that allows clinicians to view the sigmoid\\ncolon (the part of the large intestine before the rectum).\\nThis procedure is important for detection of colorectal\\ncancer. It is safe, quick to perform (usually 30–45 min-\\nutes in about 90% of cases), and an effective diagnostic\\ntool for evaluation of:\\n/C15rectal bleeding\\n/C15other abnormalities detected by imaging studies\\n/C15removal of polyps\\n/C15biopsy\\n/C15evaluation of chronic diarrhea or inflammatory\\nbowel disease\\n/C15recurrences of colorectal cancer or polyps\\n/C15relieving a twisted bowel\\n/C15foreign body removal\\n/C15treating bleeding lesions\\n/C15preventive surveillance of cancer in patients with a\\npositive family history of colon cancer\\nPrecautions\\nAntibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely recom-\\nmended. In some cases of prosthetic heart valves,\\nantibioticscan be prescribed. Evidence exists that\\nevacuation of intestinal waste products in conjunction\\nwith antibiotics before (prophylactic) the procedure\\nreduces the possibility of sepsis (infection which\\nspreads from the primary site to blood).\\nDescription\\nThe bowel is emptied of any contents for such\\nprocedures asbarium enema(introducing a compound\\ncontaining barium to promote better visualization of\\nintestines during x rays) or colonoscopy. Preparation of\\nthe bowel distally—from the rectum—is necessary for\\nsuch diagnostic procedures as sigmoidoscopy. Bowel\\nemptying is done through taking oral laxative solutions\\nthat speed up the excretion of the contents of the lower\\nbowel together with restrictions on solid food intake.\\nA newer type of imaging study may eventually\\nmake current laxative methods of bowel preparation\\nobsolete. According to a group of researchers in the\\nUnited Kingdom, computed tomography (CT) colo-\\nnography (sometimes called virtual colonoscopy) has\\nshown itself to be as accurate in diagnosing colorectal\\ntumors as optical colonoscopy. CT colonography\\nallows a radiologist to examine the colon and nearby\\norgans in less than 30 seconds.\\nPreparation\\nBowel preparation for visualization of the colon is\\nperformed to ensure the procedure will be accurate and\\ncomplete. There are several effective cleansing prepara-\\ntions including polyethylene glycol solution (Colyte),\\nsodium phosphate solution (Phospho-Soda), magne-\\nsium citrate with bisacodyl tablets, and castor oil with\\nKEY TERMS\\nLesion— An abnormal change in tissues.\\nPolyp— A growing mass of tissue.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 627\\nBowel preparation'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 657, 'page_label': '658'}, page_content='bisacodyl tablets. One of these preparations should be\\nadministered starting at 4:00 p.m. the day before the\\nprocedure. Patients are usually asked to avoid solid\\nfoods for about 36 hours before diagnostic procedures.\\nSuch clear liquids as vegetable or beef broth, apple or\\nwhite grape juice, soda pop or fruit-flavored gelatin are\\npermitted, although some doctors ask patients to avoid\\nred-colored beverages or gelatin flavors on the grounds\\nthat the red food coloring in these products may make\\nbleeding more difficult to detect.\\nIn most cases, patients may continue to take other\\nprescription medications at the usual times while they\\nare restricted to clear liquids. It is a good idea, how-\\never, to check with the doctor beforehand.\\nAftercare\\nPatients should have a friend or relative to drive\\nthem home after the procedure, as the combination of\\na period of dietary restriction, frequent bowel move-\\nments, and the procedure itself leaves most people\\nfeeling tired and slightly weak. Many doctors advise\\npatients to postpone vigorous physical activity or\\nwork requiring mental concentration until the day\\nafter the procedure.

In this proce-\\ndure, the continuity of the bowel is maintained and\\nnormal passage of stool is preserved. When deemed\\nnecessary by the surgeon, the diseased portion of the\\nbowel may be removed, and the functioning end of\\nthe intestine may be brought out onto the surface of\\nthe abdomen, forming an temporary or permanent\\nostomy. Use of the large intestine to form the ostomy\\nresults in acolostomy; use of small intestine to form the\\nostomy results in an ileostomy.\\nPreparation\\nAs with any surgical procedure, the patient will be\\nrequired to sign a consent form after the procedure is\\nexplained thoroughly. Blood and urine studies, along\\nwith various x rays and an electrocardiogram (EKG)\\nmay be ordered as the doctor deems necessary. In\\norder to empty and cleanse the bowel, the patient\\nmay be placed on a low residue diet for several days\\nprior to surgery. A liquid diet may be ordered for at\\nleast the day before surgery, with nothing taken by\\nmouth after midnight. A series ofenemas and/or oral\\npreparations (GoLytely or Colyte), may be ordered to\\nempty the bowel of stool. Oral anti-infectives (neomy-\\ncin, erythromycin, or kanamycin sulfate) may be\\nordered to decrease bacteria in the intestine and help\\nprevent post-operative infection. A nasogastric tube is\\ninserted through the nose into the stomach on the day\\nof surgery or during surgery. This removes the gastric\\nsecretions and preventsnausea and vomiting. A urinary\\ncatheter (thin tube inserted into the bladder) may also\\nbe inserted to keep the bladder empty during surgery,\\ngiving more space in the surgical field and decreasing\\nchances of accidental injury.\\nAftercare\\nPost-operative care for the patient who has had a\\nbowel resection, as with those who have had any major\\nsurgery, involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse,\\nrespirations, and temperature. Breathing tends to be\\nshallow because of the effect of anesthesia and the\\npatient’s reluctance to breathe deeply and experience\\npainthat is caused by the abdominal incision. The\\npatient is instructed how to support the operative site\\nduring deep breathing and coughing, and is given pain\\nmedication as necessary. Fluid intake and output is\\nmeasured, and the operative site is observed for color\\nand amount of wound drainage. The nasogastric tube\\nwill remain in place, attached to low intermittent suc-\\ntion until bowel activity resumes. Fluids and electro-\\nlytes are infused intravenously until the patient’s diet\\ncan gradually be resumed, beginning with liquids and\\nadvancing to a regular diet as tolerated. The patient is\\ngenerally out of bed approximately eight to 24 hours\\nafter surgery. Postoperative weight loss follows almost\\nall bowel resections.

Wright, RN\\nBowel surgery with ostomy see Colostomy\\nBowel training\\nDefinition\\nBowel training helps to reestablish normal bowel\\nmovements in persons who suffer fromconstipation,\\ndiarrhea, incontinence, or irregularity. Healthy bowel\\nactivity is considered one or two movements of mod-\\nerate size every day.\\nPurpose\\nMany people for many reasons have irregular\\nbowel function. In some cases, the irregularity lasts\\nbeyond the condition that caused it. The bowels by\\nthemselves develop bad habits that can be retrained\\nwith suitable exercises and education. Normal bowel\\nhabits not only improve the quality of life, they help\\nprevent several common diseases–for example,diver-\\nticulitis and fecal impaction. Gall stones,appendicitis,\\ncolon cancer, hiatalhernia, diabetes, and heart disease\\nhave also been related to the quality of bowel move-\\nments and the foods that affect them.\\n/C15One of the most common causes of constipation is\\nthe laxative habit. Repeated artificial stimulation of\\nthe bowels destroys their natural emptying reflex, so\\nthat they will no longer move without artificial sti-\\nmulants. The laxative habit begins innocently\\nenough with the correct belief that bowels should\\nmove every day, however,laxatives will cause the\\nevacuation of several days worth of stool in a single\\nmovement. Impatient for stool to reaccumulate for\\nthe necessary few days, the patient takes another\\nlaxative, and the cycle begins.\\n/C15The other major cause of constipation is a diet with\\ninsufficient bulk or roughage. The bowel works more\\nsmoothly the more contents it has. Westerndiets of\\nhighly refined foods have eliminated most of the\\nresidue from food. The result is that most food is\\nabsorbed, leaving little to pass through and be\\nexcreted as feces.\\n/C15Constipation occurs acutely with impaction–the pre-\\nsence in the rectum of a mass of feces too large to\\npass. Fecal impaction is usually the result of poor\\nbowel habits, a diet with too little liquid and rough-\\nage, and inadequate physical activity.\\n/C15Diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, can disrupt the\\nbowel’s normal rhythm and lead to irregularity.\\n/C15Several diseases of the nervous system affect bowel\\nreflexes.\\nDescription\\nBowel training reestablishes the bowel’s normal\\nreflexes by repeating a routine until it becomes a habit.\\nKEY TERMS\\nDefecate— To pass feces (stool) out of the rectum\\nthrough the anus.\\nDiverticulitis— Infection of outpouchings in the\\nlarge bowel.\\nFecal impaction— Obstruction of the rectum by a\\nlarge mass of feces (stool).\\nHiatal hernia— Part of the stomach displaced\\nthrough the diaphragm into the chest.\\n630 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBowel training'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 660, 'page_label': '661'}, page_content='Naturally the patient must be able and willing to\\ncooperate. Some patients are so convinced they need\\ndaily laxatives that they are afraid to do without them.\\nIt takes time for a changed diet to effect the bowels and\\nfor the bowel to regain its normal rhythm. Trust and\\npatience are necessary.\\nAfter gaining the patient’s cooperation, the next\\nstep is to optimize the diet. Healthy bowel movements\\nrequire ingestion of a large amount of liquids and bulk\\nfoods. The patient should drink two to three quarts of\\nliquids every day, with liberal inclusion of prune juice\\nand perhaps coffee for their natural laxative effect. Bulk\\ncomes from unrefined foods. Oat bran, wheat bran,\\nbrown rice, green vegetables, apples, and pears are a\\nfew examples of high residue foods. Many patients will\\nbenefit from adding bulk preparations of psyllium.\\nConstipating foods like bananas and cheese should be\\navoided until a natural rhythm is well established.\\nTo assure that stools are soft enough to pass easily,\\nit is a good idea to add a pure stool softener like DOSS\\n(dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate), two to four per day as\\nneeded. DOSS also helps prevent impaction.\\nThere is usually a time of day when bowel move-\\nments are more likely to occur. In anticipation of this\\ntime, the patient should participate in activities that\\nstimulate a normal bowel movement. Walking, eating\\nunrefined foods, and drinking prune juice or coffee,\\nencourage natural evacuation. It is acceptable to use\\nlubricants such as glycerine suppositories or oilene-\\nmas at this time. For severe constipation, water ene-\\nmas may be needed to initiate a movement.\\nIt is also important for the patient to recognize the\\nurge to defecate and to respond right away to that\\nurge.

Under certain circumstances,\\nhowever, bacteria can invade the brain and cause a\\nlocalized infection called an abscess. Brain abscess is\\nrelatively rare, accounting for 1 in 10,000 hospital\\nadmissions. Single abscess occurs in 75% of cases,\\nand the remainder of cases involve multiple abscesses.\\nIf not treated, brain abscess is almost always fatal.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOne-half of all brain abscesses are caused by the\\nspread of bacteria from a nearby infection. Sources of\\nbacteria include:\\n/C15middle ear infections (otitis media)o ri n f e c t i o n si nt h e\\nbony spaces in front of the middle ear (mastoiditis)\\n/C15sinus infections\\n/C15an abscessed tooth.\\nOther sources of bacteriainclude lung infections,\\nabdominal infection, infection of the heart’s lining(endo-\\ncarditis)penetrating heart wounds, and neurosurgery.\\nAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)\\nor the presence of another immune deficiency greatly\\nincreases the risk of brain abscess. Approximately\\n25% of cases have no detectable cause of infection.\\nBrain abscess can be caused by a variety of organ-\\nisms, many of them related to ear and sinus infections.\\nMany times brain abscess cases are caused by two or\\nmore bacteria. In 30–60% of cases, the bacteria\\ncombination includes streptococci, microorganisms\\nthat can live without oxygen (anaerobes), and enter-\\nobacteria. A small number of cases are caused by\\nyeast, fungi, and single-cell organisms (protozoa).\\nThe symptoms of brain abscess often develop\\nslowly, usually within a period of about two weeks.\\nThe most common symptoms are:\\n/C15headache\\n/C15neurologic symptoms related to the specific part of\\nthe brain that is infected\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 631\\nBrain abscess'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 661, 'page_label': '662'}, page_content='/C15altered mental status\\n/C15seizures\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of brain abscess is performed by using\\na computed tomography scan (CT) or a magnetic\\nresonance imaging(MRI) scan to determine the site of\\ninfection. Tissue removal (biopsy) is usually performed\\nas well. A biopsy is performed to determine the type of\\nbacterium involved. Biopsies can also be used to rule\\nout tumor or other noninfectious localized lesions,\\nwhich may look the same on the scans.\\nOther tests are performed to determine the source\\nof the infection. These tests include blood cultures,\\nx rays of the chest, and a physical exam of the ears,\\nsinuses, and teeth. A test for humanimmunodeficiency\\nvirus (HIV) is usually also performed.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for brain abscess begins with intrave-\\nnous antibiotics, chosen to match the infecting bacter-\\nium if known, or to cover a wide spectrum of\\npossibilities if not. Treatment usually continues for\\nsix to eight weeks.\\nAspiration surgery is almost always done to drain\\nthe abscess. In this procedure, a needle is guided to the\\ninfected site by CT scan, and fluid is removed (aspi-\\nrated) from the abscess. Aspiration may be repeated\\nseveral times until the bacteria are completely killed or\\nremoved. Surgical removal of infected or dead tissue\\nmay be needed in some cases. For patients with many\\nsites of infection, aspiration or surgical removal is not\\ndone because of the increased difficulty and risk of the\\nprocedure. For these patients, antibiotic therapy alone\\nis used. Steroid treatment is controversial, but may be\\nindicated in some cases.\\nPrognosis\\nEven with prompt treatment, brain abscess is fatal\\nin about 20% of cases. About half of those who\\nsurvive have some residual neurological problems,\\nincluding seizures in many patients.\\nThere are several reasons why patients with brain\\nabscess can have a poor prognosis. The illness may\\nnot be diagnosed correctlyor an accurate diagnosis\\nmay take additional time. The patient may receive an\\nantibiotic that does not match the infecting organ-\\nism. Sometimes the infection may not be limited to a\\ndefinite area in the brain, making diagnosis and treat-\\nment difficult. The small number of cases caused by\\nfungal infection may take additional time to diag-\\nnose.

Unlike other tumors, brain tumors spread\\nby local extension and rarely metastasize (spread)\\noutside the brain. A benign brain tumor is composed\\nof non-cancerous cells and does not metastasize\\nbeyond the part of the brain where it originates. A\\nbrain tumor is considered malignant if it contains\\ncancercells, or if it is composed of harmless cells\\nlocated in an area where it suppresses one or more\\nvital functions.\\nDescription\\nEach year, more than 17,000 brain tumors are\\ndiagnosed in the United States. About half of all pri-\\nmary brain tumors are benign, but in life-threatening\\nlocations. The rest are malignant and invasive.\\nBenign brain tumors\\nBenign brain tumors, composed of harmless cells,\\nhave clearly defined borders, can usually be comple-\\ntely removed, and are unlikely to recur. Benign brain\\ntumors do not infiltrate nearby tissues but can cause\\nseverepain, permanent brain damage, and death.\\nBenign brain tumors sometimes become malignant.\\nMalignant brain tumors\\nMalignant brain tumors do not have distinct bor-\\nders. They tend to grow rapidly, increasing pressure\\nwithin the brain (IICP) and can spread in the brain or\\nspinal cord beyond the point where they originate. It is\\nhighly unusual for malignant brain tumors to spread\\nbeyond the central nervous system (CNS).\\nPrimary brain tumors\\nPrimary brain tumors originate in the brain. They\\nrepresent about 1% of all cancers and 2.5% of all\\ncancer deaths.\\nMetastatic or secondary brain tumors\\nApproximately 25% of all cancer patients develop\\nsecondary or metastatic brain tumors when cancer\\ncells spread from another part of the body to the\\nbrain. Secondary brain tumors are most apt to occur\\nin patients who have:\\n/C15breast cancer.\\n/C15colon cancer.\\n/C15kidney cancer.\\n/C15lung cancer.\\n/C15melanoma (cancer) of the skin.

Primary brain cancer is the\\nsecond most common cause of cancer death between\\nbirth and the age of 34, and the fourth most common\\ncause of cancer death in men aged 35-54. Primary\\ntumors of the brain and central nervous system are\\noften associated with HIV infection. Men and cau-\\ncasians have a higher risk of developing brain\\ntumors. Other risk factors being studied include chil-\\ndren with a history of previous radiation treatment\\nto the head for cancer; parents with certain cancers\\n(nervous system, salivary gland, colon); having an\\nolder father; having well-educated parents; occupa-\\ntional exposure to vinyl chloride, lead, and pesti-\\ncides; history of epilepsy; history of certain genetic\\nconditions (tuberous sclerosis,neurofibromatosis, von\\nHippel Lindau, familial polyposis , Osler-Weber-\\nRendu, Li-Fraumeni).\\nNaming and grading brain tumors\\nThe name of a brain tumor describes where it\\noriginates, how it grows, and what kind of cells it\\ncontains. A tumor in an adult is also graded or staged\\naccording to:\\n/C15how malignant it is\\n/C15how rapidly it is growing and how likely it is to\\ninvade other tissues\\n/C15how closely its cells resemble normal cells. (The more\\nabnormal a tumor cell looks, the faster it is likely to\\ngrow)\\nLow-grade brain tumors usually have well-\\ndefined borders. Some low-grade brain tumors form\\nor are enclosed (encapsulated) in cysts. Low-grade\\nbrain tumors grow slowly, if at all. They may spread\\nthroughout the brain, but rarely metastasize to other\\nparts of the body.\\nMid-grade and high-grade tumors grow more\\nrapidly than low-grade tumors. Described as ‘‘truly\\nmalignant,’’ these tumors usually infiltrate healthy\\ntissue. The growth pattern makes it difficult to remove\\nthe entire tumor, and these tumors recur more often\\nthan low-grade tumors.\\nA single brain tumor can contain several different\\ntypes of cells. The tumor’s grade is determined by the\\nhighest-grade (most malignant) cell detected under a\\nmicroscope, even if most of the cells in the tumor are\\nless malignant. An infiltrating tumor is a tumor of any\\ngrade that grows into surrounding tissue.\\nTypes of brain tumors\\nGlioma is the term used to refer to the most pre-\\nvalent primary brain tumors. Gliomas arise from glial\\ntissue, which supports and nourishes cells that send\\nmessages from the brain to other parts of the body.\\nThese tumors may be either malignant or benign.\\nAstrocytomas, ependymomas, and mixed gliomas are\\nthree of the most common gliomas.\\nASTROCYTOMAS. Named for the star-like shape of\\ntheir cells, astrocytomas can develop on any part of\\nthe brain or spinal cord. Non-infiltrating astrocyto-\\nmas grow slowly, and rarely spread to nearby tissue.\\nMild-to-moderately anaplastic astrocytomas with\\nwell-differentiated borders do not grow as slowly as\\nnon-infiltrating astrocytomas, and they do spread to\\nsurrounding tissues.\\nAnaplastic astrocytomas, which are also called\\nGrade III astrocytomas, look more abnormal and\\ngrow more rapidly than non-infiltrating or mild-to-\\nmoderately anaplastic tumors.\\nGrade IV astrocytomas are also called glioblas-\\ntoma multiforme (GBM) tumors. Accounting for 30%\\nof all primary brain tumors, GBMs are the most com-\\nmon brain tumors in middle-aged adults. GBMs are\\nthe most malignant of all brain tumors. Because they\\ncontain a greater mixture of cells than any other brain\\ntumor, they are the most difficult to treat.\\nEPENDYMOMAS. Also called ependymal tumors,\\nependymomas account for 9% of all gliomas, and\\n5% of all intracranial tumors. These tumors, which\\nare most common in children and adolescents, begin in\\nthe very thin membranes that help form cerebrospinal\\nfluid (CSF) and line the brain cavities (ventricles) that\\ncontain it.\\nEpendymomas are usually benign, have well-\\ndifferentiated borders, resemble normal cells, and\\ngrow very slowly. The cells of anaplastic (malignant)\\nependymomas look abnormal and grow more rapidly\\nthan the cells of benign tumors.\\nMIXED GLIOMAS. These heterogeneous tumors con-\\ntain elements of astrocytomas and ependymomas and/\\nor oligodendrogliomas. These are rare tumors that\\nusually occur in middle-aged adults, grow slowly, and\\ndo not usually spread beyond the part of the brain where\\nthey originate. Mixed gliomas behave like tumors com-\\nposed of the highest-grade cells they contain.\\nNon-glial brain tumors\\nThe most common brain tumors that do not\\ndevelop from glial cells are medulloblastomas, menin-\\ngiomas, and Schwannomas.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 635\\nBrain tumor'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 665, 'page_label': '666'}, page_content='MEDULLOBLASTOMAS. Scientists once thought\\nmedulloblastomas (MDLs) developed from glial\\ncells. These fast-growing, malignant tumors are now\\nbelieved to originate in developing cells not normally\\npresent in the body after birth. They are sometimes\\ncalled primitive neurodectal tumors (PNET).\\nMDL tumors are most common in children and\\nare more common in boys than in girls. Only 30% of\\nMDL tumors occur in adults. MDL tumors usually\\noriginate in the cerebellum (the part of the brain that\\ncontrols coordination and some muscle activity), and\\nare often carried to other parts of the brain by cere-\\nbrospinal fluid. MDL tumors rarely metastasize\\nbeyond the brain and spinal cord.\\nMENINGIOMAS. Meningiomas, which represent\\nmore than 20% of all primary brain tumors, originate in\\nthe membranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord\\n(meninges). These tumors are usually benign and most\\noftenoccurin womenaged 30-50yearsold.Meningiomas\\ngrow so slowly that the brain can sometimes become\\naccustomed to their presence. Meningiomas compress,\\nrather than invade, brain tissue and may grow to be\\nquite large before any symptoms appear.\\nSCHWANNOMAS. Schwannomas originate in the\\nSchwann cells. These cells produce myelin, material\\nthat protects the acoustic nerve, which controls hear-\\ning. These benign tumors are twice as common in\\nwomen as in men, and are most often diagnosed in\\npatients between the ages 30-60.\\nSchwannomas grow very slowly, and many people\\nadapt to the slighthearing lossand balance problems\\nthat are the tumors’ earliest symptoms. A pear-shaped\\nSchwannoma can cause sudden or gradual loss of hear-\\ning in an ear. As the tumor progresses, it can press on\\nthe nerves that control movement and feeling in the\\nface, and cause headaches and facial numbness or\\ntingling. The patient may have trouble walking, swal-\\nlowing, or controlling eye movements, and the sense of\\ntaste can be affected. A Schwannoma that grows large\\nenough to press on the brainstem can be deadly.\\nCHILDHOOD BRAIN TUMORS. Brain tumors\\nthat occur in children are described as supratentorial\\n(in the upper part of the brain) or infratentorial (in\\nthe lowest part of the brain). Astrocytomas and epen-\\ndymomas are common supratentorial tumors.\\nInfratentorial tumors include medulloblastomas,\\nastrocytomas, and ependymomas.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of primary brain tumors is unknown,\\nbut people who work with rubber and certain\\nchemicals have a greater-than-average risk of develop-\\ning them.

This can be accomplished\\nsurgically, or by withdrawing tissue through a needle.\\nPurpose\\nA biopsy is recommended when a significant\\nabnormality is found, either onphysical examination\\nand/or by an imaging test. Examples of abnormality\\ncan include a breast lump felt during physical self\\nexamination or tissue changes noticed from a mam-\\nmogram test. Before a biopsy is performed, it is impor-\\ntant to make sure that the threat ofcancer cannot be\\ndisproved or ruled out by a simpler, less invasive\\nexamination. A lump may be obviously harmless\\nwhen examined by ultrasound. If this is not decisive,\\nthe presence of cancer or a variety of benign breast\\nconditions can be determined using a biopsy.\\nPrecautions\\nThe type of biopsy recommended should be con-\\nsidered. This will depend on whether the area can be\\nfelt, how well it can be seen on mammogram or ultra-\\nsound, and how suspicious it feels or appears.\\nSpecialized equipment is needed for different types of\\nbiopsy and availability may vary. Generally, needle\\nbiopsy is less invasive than surgical biopsy. It is appro-\\npriate for most, but not all situations. However, some\\nsurgeons feel it is far less accurate.\\nDescription\\nSurgical biopsy\\nIf an abnormality is not felt during a self exam-\\nination, there are signs that indicate the need for med-\\nical attention. These include:\\n/C15severe breastpain\\n/C15changes in the size of a breast or the nipple\\n/C15changes in the shape of both breast or nipple\\n/C15pitting, dumpling or redness of the breast skin\\n/C15nipple redness, irritation, or inversion\\n/C15changes in the pattern of veins visible on the surface\\nof the breast\\n/C15some types of nipple discharge\\nIf the abnormality is not felt, a needle localization\\nmust be done before the actual surgery. After local\\nanesthetic is administered, a fine wire is placed in the\\narea of concern. Either x ray or ultrasound guidance is\\nused. The patient is awake and usually sitting up.\\nThere are two types of breast biopsy considered\\nhere, excisional and incisional. An excisional biopsy is a\\nsurgical procedure, where the entire area of concern\\nand some surrounding tissue is removed. It is usually\\ndone as an outpatient procedure, in a hospital or free\\nstanding surgery center.

The malignant cells\\noriginate in the lining of the milk glands or ducts of\\nthe breast (ductal epithelium), defining this malig-\\nnancy as a cancer. Cancer cells are characterized by\\nuncontrolled division leading to abnormal growth\\nand the ability of these cells to invade normal tissue\\nlocally or to spread throughout the body, in a process\\ncalled metastasis.\\nDescription\\nBreast cancer arises in the milk-producing\\nglands of the breast tissue. Groups of glands in\\nnormal breast tissue are called lobules. The products\\nof these glands are secreted into a ductal system that\\nleads to the nipple. Depending on where in the\\nglandular or ductal unit of the breast the cancer\\narises, it will develop certain characteristics that\\nare used to sub-classify breast cancer into types.\\nThe pathologist will denote the subtype at the time of\\nevaluation with the microscope.

The more important\\nclassification is related to the evaluated tumor’s cap-\\nability to invade, as this characteristic defines the\\ndisease as a true cancer. The stage before invasive\\ncancer is calledin situ, meaning that the early malig-\\nnancy has not yet become capable of invasion. Thus,\\nductal carcinoma in situ is considered a minimal\\nbreast cancer.\\nHow breast cancer spreads\\nThe primary tumor begins in the breast itself but\\nonce it becomes invasive, it may progress beyond the\\nbreast to the regional lymph nodes or travel (metasta-\\nsize) to other organ systems in the body and become\\nsystemic in nature. Lymph is the clear, protein-rich\\nfluid that bathes the cells throughout the body.\\nLymph will work its way back to the bloodstream via\\nsmall channels known as lymphatics. Along the way,\\nthe lymph is filtered through cellular stations known\\nas nodes, thus they are called lymph nodes. Nearly all\\norgans in the body have a primary lymph node group\\nfiltering fluid that comes from that organ. In the\\nbreast, the primary lymph nodes are under the armpit,\\nor axilla. Classically, the primary tumor begins in the\\nbreast and the first place to which it is likely to spread\\nis the regional lymph nodes. Cancer, as it invades in\\nits place of origin, may also work its way into blood\\nvessels. If cancer gets into the blood vessels, the blood\\nvessels provide yet another route for the cancer to\\nspread to other organs of the body.\\nBreast cancer follows this classic progression\\nthough it often becomes systemic or widespread early\\nin the course of the disease. By the time one can feel a\\nlump in the breast it is often 0.4 inches, or one centi-\\nmeter, in size and contains roughly a million cells. It is\\nestimated that a tumor of this size may take one to five\\nyears to develop. During that time, the cancer may\\nmetastasize, or spread by lymphatics or blood to areas\\nelsewhere in the body.\\nWhen primary breast cancer spreads, it may first\\ngo to the axillary nodes. If this occurs, regional metas-\\ntasis exists. If it proceeds elsewhere either by lymphatic\\nor blood-borne spread, the patient develops systemic\\nmetastasis that may involve a number of other organs\\nin the body. Favorite sites of systemic involvement for\\nbreast cancer are the lung, bones, liver, and the skin\\nA breast cancer cell. (Phototake NYC.

As it turns out, the presence of, and the\\nactual number of, regional lymph nodes containing\\ncancer remains the single best indicator of whether or\\nnot the cancer has become widely metastatic.

In addition to\\nthose accepted factors listed above, some studies sug-\\ngest that high-fatdiets, obesity, or the use of alcohol\\nmay contribute to the risk profile. Another factor that\\ncontributes to a woman’s risk profile is hormone\\nreplacement therapy(HRT).\\nHRT provides significant relief of menopausal\\nsymptoms, prevention of osteoporosis, and possibly\\nprotection from cardiovascular disease and stroke.\\nWhile physicians have long known a small increased\\nrisk for breast cancer was linked to use of HRT, a\\nlandmark study released in 2003 proved the risk was\\ngreater than thought. The Women’s Health Initiative\\nfound that even relatively short-term use of estrogen\\nplus progestin is associated with increased risk of\\nbreast cancer, diagnosis at a more advanced stage of\\nthe disease, and a higher number of abnormal mam-\\nmograms. The longer a woman used HRT, the more\\nher risk increased.\\nOf all the risk factors listed above, family history\\nis the most important. In The Biological Basis of\\nCancer, the authors estimate that about half of all\\nfamilial breast cancer cases (families in which there is\\na high breast cancer frequency) have mutations affect-\\ning the genes BRCA-1 or BRCA-2. In 2003, scientists\\ndiscovered a third gene called EMSY. However, breast\\ncancer due to heredity is only a small proportion of\\nbreast cancer cases; only 5%–10% of all breast cancer\\ncases will be women who inherited a susceptibility\\nthrough their genes. Nevertheless, when the family\\nhistory is strong for development of breast cancer, a\\nwoman’s risk is increased.\\nNot all lumps detected in the breast are cancerous.\\nFibrocystic changes in the breast are extremely com-\\nmon. Also known asfibrocystic condition of the breast,\\nfibrocystic changes are a leading cause of non-\\ncancerous lumps in the breast. Fibrocystic changes\\nalso cause symptoms ofpain, swelling, or discharge\\nand may become evident to the patient or physician as\\na lump that is either solid or filled with fluid. Complete\\ndiagnostic evaluation of any significant breast\\nabnormality is mandatory because though women\\ncommonly develop fibrocystic changes, breast cancer\\nis common also, and the signs and symptoms of fibro-\\ncystic changes overlap with those of breast cancer.\\nCertain benign changes in the breast may now be\\nlinked to increased risk for breast cancer.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of breast cancer is accomplished\\nby the biopsy of any suspicious lump or mammo-\\ngraphic abnormality that has been identified.\\n(A biopsy is the removal of tissue for examination\\nby a pathologist.

The American Cancer\\nSociety (ACS) has made recommendations for the use\\nof mammography on a screening basis. In 2003, the\\nACS updated its guidelines concerning screening mam-\\nmograms. The most notable change was that women\\nshould begin annual screening at age 40 instead of age\\n50. (in the past, the ACS, recommended beginning\\nmammograms at age 40, but only ever one or two\\nyears instead of annually.) Women at higher risk for\\nbreast cancer should benefit from beginning screenings\\nat earlier ages and at more frequent intervals.\\nBecause of the greater awareness of breast cancer\\nin recent years, screening evaluations by examinations\\nand mammography are performed much more fre-\\nquently than in the past. The result is that the number\\nof breast cancers diagnosed increased, but the disease is\\nbeing diagnosed at an earlier stage than previously. The\\nearlier the stage of disease at the time it is discovered,\\nthe better the long-term outcome (prognosis) becomes.\\nWhen a patient has physical signs or symptoms\\nA common finding that leads to diagnosis is the\\npresence of a lump within the breast. Skin dimpling,\\nnipple retraction, or discharge from the nipple are less\\nfrequent initial findings prompting biopsy. Though\\nbloody nipple discharge is distressing, it is most often\\ncaused by benign disease. Skin dimpling or nipple\\nretraction in the presence of an underlying breast\\nmass on examination is a more advanced finding.\\nActual skin involvement, withedema or ulceration of\\nthe skin, are late findings.\\nThe presence of a breast lump is a common sign of\\nbreast cancer. If the lump is suspicious and the patient\\nhas not had a mammogram by this point, a study\\nshould be done on both breasts prior to anything else\\nso that the original characteristics of the lesion can be\\nstudied. The opposite breast should also be evaluated\\nmammographically to determine if other problems\\nexist that were undetected by physical examination.\\nWhether an abnormal screening mammogram or\\none of the signs mentioned above followed by a mam-\\nmogram prompted suspicion, the diagnosis is estab-\\nlished by obtaining tissue by biopsy of the area. There\\nare different types of biopsy, each utilized with its own\\nindication. If signs of widespread metastasis are\\nalready present, biopsy of the metastasis itself may\\nestablish diagnosis.\\nBiopsy\\nDepending on the situation, different types of biopsy\\nmay be performed. The types include incisional and\\nexcisional biopsies. In an incisional biopsy, the physician\\ntakes a sample of tissue, and in excisional biopsy,\\nt h em a s si sr e m o v e d .F i n en e edle aspiration biopsy and\\ncore needle biopsy are kinds of incisional biopsies.\\nFINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY. In a fine needle\\naspiration biopsy, a fine-gauge needle may be passed\\ninto the lesion and cells from the area suctioned into\\nthe needle can be quickly prepared for microscopic\\nevaluation (cytology). (The patient experiencing nip-\\nple discharge also can have a sample taken of the\\ndischarge for cytological evaluation.) Fine needle\\naspiration is a simple procedure that can be done\\nunderlocal anesthesia, and will tell if the lesion is a\\nfluid-filled cyst or whether it is solid. The sample\\nobtained will yield much diagnostic information.\\nFine needle aspiration biopsy is an excellent technique\\nwhen the lump is palpable and the physician can easily\\nhit the target with the needle. If the lesion is a simple\\ncyst, the fluid will be evacuated and the mass will\\ndisappear. If it is solid, the diagnosis may be obtained.\\nCare must be taken, however, because if the mass is\\nsolid and the specimen is non-malignant, a complete\\nremoval of the lesion may be appropriate to be sure.\\nCORE NEEDLE BIOPSY. Core needle biopsies also are\\nobtained simply under local anesthesia. The larger piece\\nof tissue obtained with its preserved architecture may\\nbe helpful in confirming the diagnosis short of open\\nsurgical removal. An open surgical incisional biopsy is\\nrarely needed for diagnosis because of the needle tech-\\nniques. If there remains question as to diagnosis, a\\ncomplete open surgical biopsy may be required.\\nEXCISIONAL BIOPSY. When performed, the exci-\\nsional (complete removal) biopsy is a minimal out-\\npatient procedure often done under local anesthesia.\\nNON-PALPABLE LESIONS. As screening increases,\\nnon-palpable lesions demonstrated only by mammo-\\ngraphy are becoming more common. The use of x rays\\nand computers to guide the needle for biopsy or to\\nplace markers for the surgeon performing the exci-\\nsional biopsy are commonly employed. Some benign\\nlesions can be fully removed by multiple directed core\\nbiopsies. These techniques are very appealing because\\nthey are minimally invasive; however, the physician\\nneeds to be careful to obtain a good sample.\\nOther tests\\nIf a lesion is not palpable and has simple cystic char-\\nacteristics on mammography, ultrasound may be util-\\nized both to determine that it is a cyst and to guide its\\nevacuation. Ultrasound may also be used in some cases to\\nguide fine needle or core biopsies of the breast.\\nComputed tomography (CT) scans have only rare\\nin the evaluation of breast lesions.Magnetic resonance\\n646 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBreast cancer'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 676, 'page_label': '677'}, page_content='imaging (MRI) has been used more often in recent\\nyears to follow up on suspicious findings from mam-\\nmograms or for certain patients.\\nTreatment\\nStaging\\nOnce diagnosis is established and before treatment\\nis rendered, more tests are done to determine if the\\ncancer has spread beyond the breast. These tests include\\nachest x rayand blood countwith liver function tests.\\nAlong with the liver function measured by the blood\\nsample, the level of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme\\nfrom bone, is also determined. A radionuclear bone\\nscan may be ordered. This test looks at the places in\\nthe body to which breast cancer usually metastasizes. A\\nCT scan also may be ordered. The physician will do a\\ncareful examination of the axillae to assess likelihood of\\nregional metastasis. Sometimes, the physician removed\\nall of the axillary lymph nodes to assess breast cancer\\nstage. However, recent studies show great success with\\nsentinel lymph node biopsy. This technique removes the\\nsentinel lymph node, or that lymph node that receives\\nfluid drainage first from the area where the cancer is\\nlocated. If this node is free of cancer, staging can be\\nassigned accordingly. This method saves women the\\ndiscomfort and side effects associated with removing\\nadditional lymph nodes in her armpit.\\nUsing the results of these studies, clinical stage is\\ndefined for the patient. This helps define treatment\\nprotocol and prognosis. After surgical treatment, the\\nfinal, or pathologic, stage is defined as the true axillary\\nlymph node status is known. Detailed staging criteria\\nare available from the American Joint Commission\\non Cancer Manual and are generalized here:\\n/C15Stage 1—The cancer is no larger than 2 cm (0.8 in)\\nand no cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes.\\n/C15Stage 2—The cancer is between 2 cm and 5 cm, and\\nthe cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.\\n/C15Stage 3A—Tumor is larger than 5 cm (2 in) or is\\nsmaller than 5 cm, but has spread to the lymph\\nnodes, which have grown into each other.\\n/C15Stage 3B—Cancer has spread to tissues near the\\nbreast, (local invasion), or to lymph nodes inside\\nthe chest wall, along the breastbone.\\n/C15Stage 4—Cancer has spread to skin and lymph nodes\\nbeyond the axilla or to other organs of the body.\\nTreatment\\nSurgery, radiation, andchemotherapy are all uti-\\nlized in the treatment of breast cancer. Depending on\\nthe stage, they will be used in different combinations\\nor sequences to effect an appropriate strategy for the\\ntype and stage of the disease being treated.\\nSURGERY. Historically, surgical removal of the\\nentire breast and axillary contents along with the mus-\\ncles down to the chest wall was performed as the lone\\ntherapy, (radicalmastectomy). In the last 25 years, as it\\nhas been appreciated that breast cancer often spreads\\nearly, surgery remains a primary option but other\\ntherapies have risen in importance. Recent studies\\nhave suggested that breast conserving treatment\\nimproves the quality of life.\\nToday, surgical treatment is best thought of as a\\ncombination of removal of the primary tumor and\\nstaging of the axillary lymph nodes. A modified radi-\\ncal mastectomy involves removing the whole breast\\nalong with the entire axillary contents but not the\\nmuscles of the chest wall.\\nIf the tumor is less than 1.5 (4 cm) in size and\\nlocated so that it can be removed without destroying\\nthe reasonable cosmetic appearance of the residual\\nbreast, just the primary tumor and a rim of normal\\ntissue will be removed. The axillary nodes will still be\\nremoved for staging purposes, usually through a sepa-\\nrate incision. Because of the risk of recurrence in the\\nremaining breast tissue,radiation therapy is used to\\nlessen the chance of local recurrence. This type of\\nprimary therapy is known aslumpectomy, (or segmen-\\ntal mastectomy), and axillary dissection.\\nSentinel lymph node biopsy, a technique for iden-\\ntifying which nodes in the axilla drain the tumor, has\\nbeen developed to provide selective sampling and\\nfurther lessen the degree of surgical trauma the patient\\nexperiences.\\nWhen patients are selected appropriately based on\\nthe preoperative clinical stage, all of these surgical\\napproaches have been shown to produce similar\\nresults. In planning primary surgical therapy, it is\\nimperative that the operation is tailored to fit the\\nclinical circumstance of the patient.\\nThe pathologic stage is determined after surgical\\ntreatment absolutely defines the local parameters. In\\naddition to stage, there are other tests that are very\\nnecessary to aid in decisions regarding treatment such\\nas adjuvant therapies. Adjuvant therapies are treat-\\nments utilized after the primary treatment to help\\nensure that no microscopic disease exists and to help\\nprolong patients’ survival time.\\nRADIATION THERAPY. Like surgical therapy, radia-\\ntion therapy is a local modality—it treats the tissue\\nexposed to radiation and not the rest of the body.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 647\\nBreast cancer'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 677, 'page_label': '678'}, page_content='Radiation is usually given post-operatively after surgical\\nwoundshave healed.

If the tumor was extensive or if multiple nodes\\nwere involved, the field of tissue exposed will vary\\naccordingly.

However, now that breast-preserving surgical pro-\\ntocols have beendeveloped, primaryradiation treatment\\nof the tumor is no longer performed. Radiation also has\\nan important role in the treatment of the patient with\\ndisseminated disease, particularly if it involves the skele-\\nton. Radiation therapy can affect pain control and pre-\\nvention of fracture in this circumstance.\\nDRUG THERAPY. Many breast cancers, particularly\\nthose originating in post-menopausal women, are\\nresponsive to hormones. These cancers have receptors\\non their cells for estrogen and progesterone. Part of\\nprimary tumor assessment after removal of the tumor\\nis the evaluation for the presence of these estrogen and\\nprogesterone receptors. If they are present on the can-\\ncer cells, altering the hormone status of the patient will\\ninhibit tumor growth and have a positive impact on\\nsurvival. The drug tamoxifen binds up these receptors\\non the cancer cells so that the hormones can’t have an\\neffect and, in so doing, inhibits tumor growth. If the\\npatient has these receptors present, tamoxifen is com-\\nmonly prescribed for five years as an adjunct to primary\\ntreatment. Adjuvant hormonal therapy with tamoxifen\\nhas few side effects but they have to be kept in mind,\\nparticularly the need for yearly evaluation of the uterus.\\nOther agents directed at altering hormone environment\\nare under study. Because of these agents, there is rarely\\nany need for surgical removal of hormone-producing\\nglands, such as the ovary or adrenal, that was some-\\ntimes necessary in the past.\\nIn late 2003, cancer experts were beginning to\\nrecommend a new group of drugs called aromatase\\ninhibitors (Arimidex, common name anastrozole, or\\nmore recently Femara and Novartis, common name\\nletrozole). New guidelines also recommend letrozole\\nfollowing five years of tamoxifen therapy. These drugs\\nfight breast cancer differently, but early research shows\\nthey fight it as effectively and with fewer side effects.\\nShortly after the modified radical mastectomy\\nreplaced the radical mastectomy as primary surgical\\ntreatment, survival after local treatment in stage II\\nbreast cancer was improved by the addition of che-\\nmotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy for an interval\\nof four to six months is now standard treatment\\nfor patients with stage II disease. The addition of\\nsystemic therapy to local treatment in patients who\\nhave no evidence of disease is performed on the basis\\nthat some patients have metastases that are not cur-\\nrently demonstrable because they are microscopic. By\\ntreating the whole patient early, before widespread\\ndisease is diagnosed, the adjuvant treatment improves\\nsurvival rates from roughly 60% for stage II to about\\n75% at five years after treatment. The standard regi-\\nmen of cytoxan, methotrexate, and 5-flourouracil,\\n(CMF), is given for six months and is well tolerated.\\nThe regimen of cytoxan, adriamycin (doxorubicin),\\nand 5-floururacil, (CAF), is a bit more toxic but only\\nrequires four months. (Adriamycin and cytoxin may\\nalso be used alone, without the fluorouracil.) The two\\nmethods are about equivalent in results. Adjuvant\\nhormonal therapy may be added to the adjuvant che-\\nmotherapy as they work through different routes.\\nThe encouraging results from adjuvant therapy in\\nstage II disease have led to the study of similar therapy\\nin stage I disease. The results are not as dramatic, but\\nthey are real. Currently, stage I disease is divided into\\ncategories a, b, and c on the basis of tumor size. Stage\\nIa is less than a centimeter in diameter. Adjuvant\\nhormonal or chemotherapy is now commonly recom-\\nmended for stage Ib and Ic patients. The toxicity of the\\ntreatment must be weighed individually for the patient\\nas patients with stage I disease have a survivorship of\\nover 80% without adjuvant chemotherapy.\\nIf patients are diagnosed with stage IV disease or,\\nin spite of treatment, progress to a state of widespread\\ndisease, systemic chemotherapy is utilized in a more\\naggressive fashion. In addition to the adriamycin-con-\\ntaining regimens, the taxols (docetaxel and paclitaxel)\\nhave been found to be effective in inducing remission.\\nOn the basis of prognostic factors such as total\\nnumber of involved nodes over 10, aneuploid DNA\\nwith a high synthesis value, or aggressive findings on\\nmicroscopic evaluation, some patients with stage II or\\nIII disease can be predicted to do poorly. If their\\nperformance status allows, they can be considered for\\ntreatment with highly aggressive chemotherapy. The\\ntoxicity is such that bone marrow failure will result. To\\nget around this anticipated side effect of the aggressive\\ntherapy, either the patients will be transplanted with\\ntheir own stem cells, (the cells that will give rise to new\\nmarrow), or a traditionalbone marrow transplantation\\nwill be required. This therapy can be a high-risk proce-\\ndure for patients. It is given with known risk to patients\\n648 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBreast cancer'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 678, 'page_label': '679'}, page_content='predicted to do poorly and only if it is felt they can\\ntolerate it.

Over 80% of stage I patients\\nare cured by current therapies.

The results yielded from the study showed\\nthat tamoxifen significantly reduced breast cancer\\nrisk, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\\napproved the use of tamoxifen to reduce breast cancer\\nrisk for high-risk patients in 1998.

The incision is made through the armpit,\\nunder the breast, or around the areola (the darkened\\narea around the nipple). These techniques create the\\nmost inconspicuousscars. The implant is placed\\nbetween the breast tissue and underlying chest muscle,\\nor under the chest muscle. The operation takes approxi-\\nmately one to two hours. The cost of a cosmetic proce-\\ndure is rarely covered by insurance. However, if\\nenlargement is part of breast reconstruction after a\\nmastectomy, health plans may pay for some or all of\\nit.

Weber, MSN\\nBreast infection see Mastitis\\nBreast radiography see Mammography\\nBreast reconstruction\\nDefinition\\nBreast reconstruction is a series of surgical proce-\\ndures performed to recreate a breast. Reconstructions\\nare commonly done after one or both breasts are\\nremoved as a treatment forbreast cancer. Also, a\\nbreast may need to be refashioned for other reasons,\\nsuch as trauma or abnormalities that occur during\\nbreast development.\\nPurpose\\nMany authorities consid er reconstruction an\\nintegral part of the therapy for breast cancer.A\\nbreast that appears natural offers a sense of whole-\\nness and normalcy, which can aid in the psychologi-\\ncal recovery from breast cancer. It eliminates the need\\nfor an external prosthesis (false breast), which many\\nwomen find physically uncomfortable as well as\\ninconvenient.\\nPrecautions\\nNot all women are good candidates for breast\\nreconstruction. Overall poor physical health, or speci-\\nfic problems such as cigarettesmoking, obesity, high\\nblood pressure, or diabetes, will increase the chance of\\ncomplications. Also, a difficult and/or prolonged\\nrecovery period or failure of the reconstruction may\\nbe a result. A woman’s physical ability to cope with\\nmajor surgery and recuperation also need to be\\nconsidered.\\nDescription\\nBreast reconstruction is done in two stages, with\\nthe ultimate goal of creating a breast which looks and\\nfeels as natural as possible. It is important to remem-\\nber that while a good result may mimic a normal\\nbreast closely, there will inevitably bescars and loss\\nof sensation. The reconstructed breast cannot be\\nexactly like the original.\\nThe first step is to form a structure called a breast\\nmound.

It even can\\nbe done during the same procedure as themastectomy,\\nor it can be delayed. There are psychological benefits to\\nIR. The ability to return to normal activities and rou-\\ntines is often enhanced when reconstruction follows\\nimmediately after mastectomy. A better appearance\\nmay result from IR. There is less skin removal, often\\nresulting in a shorter scar. The surgeon is better able to\\npreserve the normal boundaries of the breast, so it is\\neasier to match the opposite breast more closely.\\nThe cost of IR is generally lower than the cost of\\ndelayed reconstruction (DR). There is one fewer opera-\\ntion and hospital stay. Surgeon’s fees may be lower for\\na combined procedure than for two separate surgeries.\\nThere are disadvantages of IR as well.

The initial mastectomy procedure\\nalone takes less time, and has a shorter recovery period\\nand less pain than mastectomy and IR. The patient\\nhas more time to adjust to her diagnosis and recover\\nfrom additional therapy. She is better able to research\\nher options, and to formulate realistic goals for\\nreconstruction. Some reconstructive surgery requires\\nblood transfusions. With DR, the patient can donate\\nher own blood ahead of time (autologoustransfusion),\\nand/or arrange to have family and friends donate\\nblood for her use (directed donation).\\nThe psychologicalstress of living without a breast\\nis a disadvantage of DR. The extra procedure DR\\nentails results in higher costs. Although initial recov-\\nery is faster, an additional recuperation period is\\nrequired after the delayed operation.\\nType of reconstruction\\nThere are two basic choices for breast reconstruc-\\ntion. The breast tissue can be replaced with an implant\\nor the breast is created using some of the woman’s own\\ntissues (autologous reconstruction).\\nARTIFICIAL IMPLANTS. In general, implant proce-\\ndures take less time, and are less expensive than auto-\\nlogous ones. Implants are breast shaped pouches.\\nThey are made of silicone outer shells, which may be\\nsmooth or textured. The inside may contain silicone\\ngel, saline (salt water), or a combination of both.\\nAn implant may be a fixed volume type, which\\ncannot change its size. Implants that have the capacity\\nto be filled after insertion are called tissue expanders.\\nThese may be temporary or permanent.\\nThe initial procedure for any implant insertion\\nuses the mastectomy incision to make a pocket of\\ntissue, usually underneath the chest wall muscle. In\\nDR, the mastectomy scar may be re opened and used\\nfor this purpose, or a more cosmetic incision may be\\nmade. The implant is inserted into the pocket, the skin\\nis stretched as needed and stitched closed.\\nIf there is inadequate tissue to achieve the desired\\nsize, or a naturally sagging breast is desired, a tissue\\nexpander is used. It resembles a partially deflated\\nballoon, with an attached valve or port through\\nwhich saline can be injected. After the initial surgical\\nincision is healed, the woman returns to the doctor’s\\noffice, on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, to have small\\namounts of saline injected. Injections can continue for\\nabout six to eight weeks, until the preferred size is\\nobtained. In some cases it may be overfilled, and\\nlater partially deflated to allow for a more pliable,\\nnatural result. A temporary tissue expander will be\\nremoved after several months and replaced with a\\npermanent implant.\\nIR surgery using an implant takes approximately\\ntwo to three hours, and usually requires up to a three\\nday hospital stay.

Attached flap\\nand free flap are two types of surgery where a woman’s\\ntissue is used in reconstruction. An attached flap uses\\nskin, muscle, and fat, leaving blood vessels attached to\\ntheir original source of blood. The flap is maneuvered\\nto the reconstruction site, keeping its original blood\\nsupply for nourishment. This may also be known as a\\npedicle flap. The second kind of surgery is called a free\\nflap. This also uses skin, muscle, and fat, but severs the\\nblood vessels, and attaches them to other vessels where\\nthe new breast is to be created. The surgeon uses a\\nmicroscope to accomplish this delicate task of sewing\\nblood vessels together. Sometimes the term microsur-\\ngery is used to refer to free flap procedures. Either type\\nof surgery may also be called a myocutaneous flap,\\nreferring to the skin and muscle used.\\nThe skin and muscle used in autologous recon-\\nstruction can come from one of several possible places\\non the body, including the abdomen (TRAM flap or\\n‘‘tummy tuck’’), the back (latissimus dorsi flap), or the\\nbuttocks (gluteus maximus free flap).\\nFinishing the reconstruction\\nOther procedures may be necessary to achieve the\\ngoal of symmetrical breasts. It may be necessary to\\nmake the opposite breast larger (augmentation), smal-\\nler (reduction), or higher (mastopexy). These, or any\\nother refinements should be completed before the\\ncreation of a nipple and areola. Tissue to form the\\nnew nipple may come from the reconstructed breast\\nitself, the opposite breast, or a more distant donor site,\\nsuch as the inner thigh or behind the ear. The nipple\\nand areolar construction is usually an outpatient pro-\\ncedure. A final step, often done in the doctor’s office, is\\ntattooing the new nipple and areola, to match the\\ncolor of the opposite nipple and areola as closely as\\npossible.\\nInsurance\\nInsurance coverage for breast reconstruction var-\\nies widely. Some policies will allow procedures on the\\naffected breast, but refuse to pay for alterations to the\\nopposite breast. Other plans may cover the cost of an\\nexternal prosthesis, or reconstructive surgery, but not\\nboth. As of January 1998, 25 states had different laws\\nregarding required insurance coverage for post mas-\\ntectomy reconstruction.\\nImplants may pose additional insurance concerns.\\nSome companies will withdraw coverage for women\\nwith implants, or add a disclaimer for future implant-\\nrelated problems. Careful reading of insurance poli-\\ncies, including checking on the need for pre-approval\\nand/or a second opinion, is strongly recommended.\\nPreparation\\nRoutine preoperative preparations, such as taking\\nnothing to eat or drink the night before surgery are\\nneeded for reconstructive procedures. Blood transfu-\\nsions are often necessary for autologous reconstruc-\\ntive surgeries. The patient may donate her own blood,\\nand/or have family and friends donate several weeks\\nbefore the surgery.\\nEmotional preparation is also important. Breast\\nreconstruction will not resolve a psychological problem\\nthe woman had before mastectomy, nor make an\\nunstable relationship strong. An expectation of physi-\\ncal perfection is unrealistic. A woman who cites any of\\nthese reasons for reconstruction shows that she has not\\nbeen adequately informed or prepared. Complete\\nunderstanding of the benefits and limitations of this\\nsurgery is necessary for a satisfactory result.\\nAftercare\\nThe length of the hospital stay, recovery period,\\nand frequency of visits to the doctor after surgery varies\\nconsiderably with the different kinds of reconstruction.\\nIn general, autologous procedures require longer hos-\\npitalization and recovery time than implant procedures.\\nBandages and drainage tubes remain in place for at\\nleast a day for all surgeries. Microsurgical or free flaps\\nare most closely monitored in the first day or two after\\nsurgery. The circulation to the breast may be checked as\\noften as every hour. Complete breast reconstruction\\nrequires at least one additional surgery to create a\\nnipple and areola. Scars may remain red and raised\\nfor a month or longer. The true, final appearance of\\nthe breasts will not be visible for at least one year.\\nRisks\\nSome women have reported various types of auto-\\nimmune related connective-tissue disorders, which\\nthey attribute to their implants–usually involving sili-\\ncone gel implants. Lawsuits have been filed against the\\nmanufacturers of implants. Food and Drug\\nAdministration guidelines, issued in 1992, now limit\\ntheir use to women who need to replace an existing\\nsilicone gel-filled implant, have had surgery for breast\\ncancer, or have a medical condition which results in\\nserious breast abnormality. In addition, patients must\\nsign a consent form which details the potential risks of\\nsilicone gel-filled implants, and become enrolled in a\\n654 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBreast reconstruction'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 684, 'page_label': '685'}, page_content='long range study. Saline filled implants are permitted\\nfor all uses, although manufacturers must collect data\\non possible risks.\\nThe FDA issued a status report on Breast Implant\\nSafety in 1995, and revised it in March 1997. It noted\\nthat studies so far have not shown a serious increase\\nin the risk of recognized autoimmune diseases in\\nwomen with silicone gel-filled breast implants. It also\\naddressed concerns about other complications and\\nemphasized the need for further study of this issue.\\nThere are a number of risks common to any surgi-\\ncal procedure such as bleeding, infection, anesthesia\\nreaction, or unexpected scarring. Hematoma (accumu-\\nlation of blood at the surgical site), or seroma (collec-\\ntion of fluid at the surgical site) can delay healing if not\\ndrained. Any breast reconstruction also poses a risk of\\nasymmetry and/or the need for unplanned surgical revi-\\nsion. Persistent pain is another potential complication\\npossible with all types of breast reconstruction.\\nImplants have some unique problems that may\\ndevelop. A thick scar, also called a capsule, forms\\naround the implant, as part of the body’s normal\\nreaction to a foreign substance. Capsular contracture\\noccurs when the scar becomes firm or hardened. This\\nmay cause pain and/or change the texture and appear-\\nance of the breast. Implants can rupture and leak,\\ndeflate, or become displaced. The chances of capsular\\ncontracture or rupture increase with the age of the\\nimplant. These complications can usually be remedied\\nwith outpatient surgery to loosen the capsule or\\nremove and/or replace the implant as needed.

Patients usually find that the procedure is\\nless traumatic and more comfortable than surgical\\nbiopsies. Ultrasound is known for its accuracy in\\ndetermining how far a cancerous growth extends\\ninto the surrounding tissue in lesions that cannot be\\nfelt. Biopsies guided by ultrasound are generally less\\ncostly than surgical biopsies. Additionally, if the\\nabnormality that requires biopsy can be seen on both\\na mammogram and ultrasound, an ultrasound-guided\\nbiopsy is often more comfortable for the patient as no\\ncompression is necessary.\\nA breast ultrasound image.

Between 32-36 weeks, it becomes so large that\\nmovement is restricted. It is much harder for the fetus\\nto turn over, so whatever position it has assumed by\\nthis point is likely to be the same position that he or she\\nwill be in when labor begins.\\nFor reasons that are not fully understood, almost\\nall unborn babies settle into a head down position. The\\nfetus is upside down in the uterus, and the head will\\nlead the way during the birth process.\\nUnfortunately, some fetuses do not cooperate.\\nMost of these are in the breech position. The buttocks\\nlead the way out of the uterus, and the legs are folded\\nin front of the body (frank breech). Delivery from the\\nbreech position poses far more risks than delivery head\\nfirst (vertex position).\\nThe biggest part of the fetus’s body is usually its\\nhead. If the head fits through the mother’s pelvis, then\\nthe rest of the fetus’s body should slip out fairly easily.\\nIf the fetus is born bottom first, it is possible that\\nthe body will fit through the mother’s pelvis, but the\\nbaby’s head will get stuck at the level of the chin. This\\ncondition, known as a trapped head, is very dangerous.\\nWhen the baby’s head comes first, it has a chance\\nto ‘‘mold’’ during labor. The bones of the baby’s skull\\nare not yet fastened together the way they are in a child\\nor adult’s skull, meaning that the bones of the baby’s\\nskull can move. During the long hours of labor the\\nskull can change shape to fit through the pelvis more\\neasily, which is why many babies are born with a ‘‘cone\\nhead’’. If the baby is born from the breech position,\\nthe skull does not have a chance to change shape to fit\\nthe pelvis, and it is even more likely to get stuck.\\nIf the baby’s head gets trapped, the possibility of\\ninjury is high. Once the baby’s body is born, the umbi-\\nlical cord usually stops pulsating (just as it would\\nduring a normal delivery). This cuts off the oxygen\\nsupply from the mother to the baby. If the baby’s head\\nis still inside the uterus the baby cannot yet breathe on\\nits own. Therefore, it is essential to deliver the baby as\\nquickly as possible.\\nThe life saving attempts to deliver the baby’s head\\ncan cause injury to the baby’s neck or head resulting in\\npermanent handicaps. In extreme cases, if the baby\\ncannot be delivered within a few minutes, the baby\\nmight die. Obviously, it is critical to avoid a breech\\ndelivery with a trapped head.\\nOf course, many babies are safely delivered from\\nthe breech position. There are certain factors that\\nmake a breech delivery more likely to be successful: if\\nultrasound (a technique that uses sound waves to\\nvisualize the fetus) shows that the fetus is in the frank\\nbreech position, the fetus’s head is tucked on its chest,\\nand the fetus is not big, it is less likely that its head will\\nget stuck.\\nAmong breech babies born after the full nine-\\nmonth term, smaller babies usually do better. This is\\nnot true for premature babies. Premature babies are\\nmore likely to have a trapped head because the body of\\na premature baby is usually much smaller than his or\\nher head. Premature babies are generally not delivered\\nfrom the breech position.\\nThe risks of vaginal breech delivery can be\\navoided by delivering the baby through a surgical\\nprocedure (cesarean section, also known as c-section).\\nFor the past twenty years, cesarean section has been\\nrecommended when the fetus is breech. More recently,\\nmany providers have offered the option of version,\\nattempting to turn the fetus within the uterus to a\\nhead first position before labor begins.\\nVersion is based on a very simple idea. If a fetus in\\nthe breech position does a somersault, it will end up\\nhead down. During a version, the obstetrician tries to\\nmake the fetus do a somersault.\\nPlacenta\\nUterus\\nUmbilical cord\\nBreech Birth\\nApproximately 3-4% of babies will start labor in the breech\\n(buttocks first) position. While this is a potentially danger-\\nous situation, many full-term babies can be safely delivered\\nfrom the breech position.

Another clue to the position is\\nthe location where the heartbeat is heard best. If the\\nfetus’s heartbeat is best heard below the level of the\\nmother’s navel, it is likely to be positioned head first.\\nOn the other hand, if the heartbeat is best heard above\\nthe level of the navel, it is likely to be breech.\\nThe only way to really be sure, however, is to do\\nan ultrasound exam.

This surgical procedure carries\\nmore risk for the mother, but many women prefer to\\ntake the risk of surgery on themselves rather than let\\nthe baby face the risks of breech delivery.\\nVersion is gaining in popularity. Version is a med-\\nical procedure in which the obstetrician tries to turn\\nthe breech fetus to the head first position. Version is\\nsuccessful more than 50% of the time.

This\\nshould only be attempted if ultrasound shows that the\\nfetus is in a favorable breech position. Most babies\\nwill do very well during a breech delivery, but it is\\nalways possible that the fetus will be injured, perhaps\\nseriously.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no way to prevent a fetus from settling\\ninto the breech position at the end of pregnancy.

The area of the\\nlung which should be served by a diseased bronchial\\ntube is also prone to inflammation and infection.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPrior to the widespread use of immunizations,\\nbronchiectasis was often the result of a serious infec-\\ntion with eithermeasles or whooping cough. Currently,\\nviruses that cause influenza (flu) or influenza-like\\nsyndromes, as well as a number of bacteria may pre-\\ncede the development of bronchiectasis. Patients who\\nhave been infected withtuberculosis or the virus which\\ncauses AIDS (HIV or humanimmunodeficiency virus)\\nalso have an increased chance of bronchiectasis.\\nA number of pre-existing conditions may cause an\\nindividual to be more susceptible than normal to infec-\\ntion, with increased risk of bronchiectasis developing.\\nThese conditions include disorders of cilia, and\\nimmune disorders.\\nCilia are the tiny hairs which usually line the\\nbronchial tubes. Cilia wave constantly, sweeping the\\nbronchial tubes clean of bacterial or viral invaders,\\nand cleaning away excess secretions (mucus, sputum)\\nwhich may be produced by the bronchi. When these\\ncilia are abnormal or absent at birth, various bacterial\\nor viral invaders may remain in the respiratory tract,\\nmultiply, and cause serious infections.\\nImmune disorders include decreased production\\nof certain immune chemicals (immunoglobulins)\\nwhich usually serve to fight off infection by bacterial\\nor viral invasion. When these immunoglobulins are\\nnot produced in large enough quantity, bacterial\\nand viral invaders are not effectively killed off, and\\ninfection occurs.\\nOther causes of bronchiectasis include an abnor-\\nmally blocked (obstructed) airway. This can be due to\\ntumor growth within the bronchial tube, or due to a\\nchild accidentally inhaling a small object which then\\nblocks off the bronchial tube. People with the disease\\ncalled cystic fibrosis (CF) often have their bronchial\\ntubes obstructed by the thick, sticky mucus which is a\\nhallmark of CF. Toxic exposures (breathing ammo-\\nnia, for example) can harm the bronchi, and lead to\\nbronchiectasis. An extreme allergic response of the\\nimmune system to the presence of certain fungi (espe-\\ncially one calledAspergillus) can also damage the\\nbronchial tubes enough to result in bronchiectasis.\\nSymptoms of bronchiectasis include constant\\ncough and the production of infected sputum (sputum\\nis a mixture of mucus and pus), which may be bloody.\\nIn some cases, there may bewheezing and shortness of\\nbreath.

It occurs\\nmost often in children between the ages of two and\\n24 months, with peak infection occurring between\\nthree and six months of age. About 25% of infants\\nhave bronchiolitis during their first year, and 95%\\nhave had the disease by their second birthday. In\\ntemperate climates, bronchiolitis peaks from winter\\nto late spring. In subtropical climates, the disease\\npeaks from October to February.\\nChildren who attend daycare or who live in\\ncrowded conditions and those who are exposed to\\nsecond-hand smoke at home are more likely to develop\\nbronchiolitis. Premature infants and children born with\\nheart and lung defects or HIV/AIDS are more likely to\\nhave severe, life-threatening infections. Bronchiolitis\\noccurs more often in boys than girls, with boys being\\nhospitalized at 1.5 times the rate of girls. Bronchiolitis\\nis a significant cause of respiratory disease worldwide.\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has funded\\nresearch to develop a vaccine against the disease, but\\nthus attempts have been unsuccessful.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBronchiolitis is caused by several different viruses.\\nThe most common of these is respiratory syncytial\\nvirus (RVS), which is responsible for about 100,000\\nhospitalizations of children under age four each year.\\nTwo subtypes of RSV have been identified, one of\\nwhich causes most of the severe bronchiolitis infec-\\ntions. In addition, bronchiolitis can be caused byinflu-\\nenza, parainfluenza, and adenoviruses, all of which are\\ncommon from fall through spring. These viruses are\\nspread in tiny drops of fluid from an infected person’s\\nnose and mouth through direct contact, such as shak-\\ning hands, or kissing. The viruses can also live several\\nhours on countertops, toys, or used tissues and easily\\ninfect people who handle contaminated items. The\\ntime from infection to the appearance of symptoms\\nvaries from two to seven days.\\nBronchiolitis affects individuals differently\\ndepending on their age.

The lungs are not involved, and these\\nsymptoms clear up without any medical treatment. In\\nsome children under age two, the cold-like upper\\nrespiratory symptoms worsen after a day or two. The\\nlung tissue begins to swell and produce mucus, and\\nthe cells lining the bronchioles begin to slough off\\ninto the air passages. As the airways narrow from\\nswelling, and mucus accumulation, breathing becomes\\ndifficult, and the child makes awheezing or whistling\\nsound with each breath. Lung involvement can occur\\nquite rapidly.\\nThe most common signs of bronchiolitis involve\\nthe infant’s struggle to breathe. The child may take\\n50–60 breaths per minute and may develop brief per-\\niods when they stop breathing (apnea) and begin to\\nturn blue (cyanosis). This occurs most often in babies\\nwho were born very prematurely or who are under six\\nweeks of age and babies with congenital heart and lung\\nproblems and compromised immune systems. Babies\\nmay also stop eating, because it is becomes difficult\\nfor them to swallow and breathe at the same time.\\nThey may have a lowfever, cough, andvomiting.\\nDiagnosis\\nBronchiolitis is usually diagnosed through aphy-\\nsical examination by a pediatrician or family physi-\\ncian. The physician often finds an increased heart\\nrate, rapid, labored breathing, and crackles in the\\nlungs when the child inhales. Signs of ear infection\\n(otitis media) and throat infection (pharyngitis) are\\nsometimes present.\\nAlthough laboratory tests are available that can\\nwithin in a few hours confirm the presence of RSV,\\nthese tests are not routinely necessary. The oxygen\\nlevel in the blood may be measured through pulse\\noximetry in babies who are having difficulty breathing.\\nInadequate oxygen in the blood is an indication that\\nhospitalization is necessary. Chest x-rays may be done\\non severely ill children to rule out other conditions.\\nTreatment\\nThe degree of respiratory distress determines\\ntreatment. Individuals with mild symptoms are treated\\nas if they have a cold with rest, fluids, and a cool\\nair humidifier. Babies who are struggling to breath\\nmay hospitalized and given supplemental humidified\\noxygen. Their breathing will be monitored and if\\nnecessary fluids will be given intravenously to prevent\\ndehydration. Occasionally infants need mechanical\\nventilation to fill and empty the lungs until the airways\\nopen.\\nThose children with compromised immune sys-\\ntems from diseases such as congenital HIV/AIDS\\nand transplant patients are at highest risk for severe\\ninfections, serious complications, anddeath. Children\\nwith congenital heart and lung disorders are also at\\nhigher risk, as are infants under six weeks old. These\\nhigh risk children may be admitted to pediatric inten-\\nsive care units and treated with ribvarin (Virazole), a\\ndrug that keeps the virus from reproducing. This drug\\nis reserved for the most critical cases.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlthough there are alternative treatments for\\ncold symptoms, such asechinacea and zinc, parents\\nshould consult their health practitioner about the\\nappropriateness of using these treatments in very\\nyoung children.\\nPrognosis\\nThe majority of children who get bronchiolitis,\\neven severe infections, recover without complications\\nin one to two weeks, althoughfatigue and a light\\ncough may linger longer. About 60% of people\\ndevelop only cold-like symptoms without lung invol-\\nvement. However, the disease accounts for about\\n100,000 pediatric hospitalizations and 4,500 deaths\\neach year. Deaths usually occur because medical care\\nis not sought soon enough.\\nAlthough many viral illnesses, like chicken pox,\\ncan be contracted only once, after which individuals\\ndevelop immunity, people can get bronchiolitis multi-\\nple times. However, after the first infection, the symp-\\ntoms are usually mild.\\nPrevention\\nThe viruses that cause bronchiolitis spread very\\neasily, making prevention difficult. Common sense\\nmeasures such as frequent hand washing and keeping\\nchildren away from crowds and sick individuals are\\nonly partially effective. Certain very high risk babies\\ncan be treated during the peak virus season with\\nmonthly injections of antiviral immunoglobulins to\\nprotect against RSV infection.

M.\\nBronchitis\\nDefinition\\nBronchitis is an inflammation of the air passages\\nbetween the nose and the lungs, including the wind-\\npipe or trachea and the larger air tubes of the lung that\\nbring air in from the trachea (bronchi). Bronchitis can\\neither be of brief duration (acute) or have a long course\\n(chronic). Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a viral\\ninfection, but can also be caused by a bacterial infec-\\ntion and can heal without complications. Chronic\\nbronchitis is a sign of serious lung disease that may\\nbe slowed but cannot be cured.\\nDescription\\nAlthough acute and chronic bronchitis are both\\ninflammations of the air passages, their causes and\\ntreatments are different. Acute bronchitis is most pre-\\nvalent in winter. It usually follows a viral infection,\\nsuch as a cold or the flu, and can be accompanied by\\na secondary bacterial infection. Acute bronchitis\\nresolves within two weeks, although thecough may\\npersist longer. Acute bronchitis, like any upper airway\\ninflammatory process, can increase a person’s likeli-\\nhood of developingpneumonia.\\nAnyone can get acute bronchitis, but infants,\\nyoung children, and the elderly are more likely to get\\nthe disease because people in these age groups generally\\nhave weaker immune systems. Smokers and people\\nwith heart or other lung diseases are also at higher\\nrisk of developing acute bronchitis. Individuals exposed\\nto chemical fumes or high levels of air pollution also\\nhave a greater chance of developing acute bronchitis.\\nChronic bronchitis is a major cause of disability\\nand death in the United States. The American Lung\\nAssociation estimates that about 14 million Americans\\nsuffer from the disease. Like acute bronchitis, chronic\\nbronchitis is an inflammation of airways accom-\\npanied by coughing and spitting up of phlegm. In\\nchronic bronchitis, these symptoms are present for\\nat least three months in each of two consecutive\\nyears.\\nChronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling bronchial\\nirritants, especially cigarette smoke. Until recently,\\nmore men than women developed chronic bronchitis,\\nbut as the number of women who smoke has\\nincreased, so has their rate of chronic bronchitis.\\nBecause this disease progresses slowly, middle-aged\\nand older people are more likely to be diagnosed\\nwith chronic bronchitis.\\nChronic bronchitis is one of a group of diseases\\nthat fall under the name chronic obstructive pulmon-\\nary disease (COPD). Other diseases in this category\\ninclude emphysema and chronic asthmatic bronchitis.\\nChronic bronchitis may progress to emphysema, or\\nboth diseases may be present together.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAcute— Disease or condition characterized by the\\nrapid onset of severe symptoms.\\nBronchi— The larger air tubes of the lung that bring\\nair in from the trachea.\\nChronic— Disease or condition characterized by\\nslow onset over a long period of time.\\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)—\\nA term used to describe chronic lung diseases, like\\nchronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma.\\nEmphysema— One of the several diseases called\\nchronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, emphy-\\nsema involves the destruction of air sac walls to\\nform abnormally large air sacs that have reduced\\ngas exchange ability and that tend to retain air\\nwithin the lungs. Symptoms include labored\\nbreathing, the inability to forcefully blow air out\\nof the lungs, and an increased susceptibility to\\nrespiratory tract infections.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 665\\nBronchitis'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 695, 'page_label': '696'}, page_content='Causes and symptoms\\nAcute bronchitis\\nAcute bronchitis usually begins with the symp-\\ntoms of a cold, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and\\ndry cough. However, the cough soon becomes deep\\nand painful. Coughing brings up a greenish yellow\\nphlegm or sputum. These symptoms may be accom-\\npanied by afever of up to 102/C14F (38.8/C14C). Wheezing\\nafter coughing is common.\\nIn uncomplicated acute bronchitis, the fever and\\nmost other symptoms, except the cough, disappear\\nafter three to five days. Coughing may continue for\\nseveral weeks. Acute bronchitis is often complicated\\nby a bacterial infection, in which case the fever and a\\ngeneral feeling of illness persist. To be cured, the\\nbacterial infection should be treated withantibiotics.\\nChronic bronchitis\\nChronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling respira-\\ntory tract irritants. The most common irritant is\\ncigarette smoke. The American Lung Association\\nestimates that 80-90% of COPD cases are caused by\\nsmoking. Other irritants include chemical fumes, air\\npollution, and environmental irritants, such as mold\\nor dust.\\nChronic bronchitis develops slowly over time. The\\ncells that line the respiratory system contain fine, hair-\\nlike outgrowths from the cell called cilia. Normally,\\nthe cilia of many cells beat rhythmically to move\\nmucus along the airways. When smoke or other irri-\\ntants are inhaled, the cilia become paralyzed or snap\\noff. When this occurs, the cilia are no longer able to\\nmove mucus, and the airways become inflamed, nar-\\nrowed, and clogged. This leads to difficulty breathing\\nand can progress to the life-threatening disease\\nemphysema.\\nA mild cough, sometimes called smokers’ cough, is\\nusually the first visible sign of chronic bronchitis.\\nCoughing brings up phlegm, although the amount var-\\nies considerably from person to person. Wheezing and\\nshortness of breathmay accompany the cough.\\nDiagnostic tests show a decrease in lung function. As\\nthe disease advances, breathing becomes difficult and\\nactivity decreases. The body does not get enough oxy-\\ngen, leading to changes in the composition of the blood.\\nDiagnosis\\nInitial diagnosis of bronchitis is based on observing\\nthe patient’s symptoms and health history. The physi-\\ncian will listen to the patient’s chest with a stethoscope\\nfor specific sounds that indicate lung inflammation,\\nsuch as moist rales and crackling, and wheezing, that\\nindicates airway narrowing. Moist rales is a bubbling\\nsound heard with a stethoscope that is caused by fluid\\nsecretion in the bronchial tubes.\\nA sputum culturemay be performed, particularly\\nif the sputum is green or has blood in it, to determine\\nwhether a bacterial infection is present and to identify\\nthe disease-causing organism so that an appropriate\\nantibiotic can be selected. Normally, the patient will\\nbe asked to cough deeply, then spit the material that\\ncomes up from the lungs (sputum) into a cup. This\\nsample is then grown in the laboratory to determine\\nwhich organisms are present. The results are available\\nin two to three days, except for tests fortuberculosis,\\nwhich can take as long as two months.\\nOccasionally, in diagnosing a chronic lung disor-\\nder, the sample of sputum is collected using a proce-\\ndure called abronchoscopy. In this procedure, the\\npatient is given a local anesthetic, and a tube is passed\\ninto the airways to collect a sputum sample.\\nA pulmonary function testis important in diagnos-\\ning chronic bronchitis and other variations of COPD.\\nThis test uses an instrument called a spirometer to\\nmeasure the volume of air entering and leaving the\\nlungs. The test is done in the doctor’s office and is\\npainless. It involves breathing into the spirometer\\nmouthpiece either normally or forcefully. Volumes\\nless than 80% of the normal values indicate an\\nobstructive lung disease.\\nTo better determine what type of obstructive lung\\ndisease a patient has, the doctor may do achest x ray,\\nelectrocardiogram (ECG), and blood tests. An electro-\\ncardiogram is an instrument that is used to measure\\nthe electrical activity of the heart and is useful in the\\ndiagnosis of heart conditions. Other tests may be used\\nto measure how effectively oxygen and carbon dioxide\\nare exchanged in the lungs.\\nTreatment\\nAcute bronchitis\\nWhen no secondary infection is present, acute\\nbronchitis is treated in the same way as thecommon\\ncold. Home care includes drinking plenty of fluids,\\nresting, not smoking, increasing moisture in the air\\nwith a cool mist humidifier, and takingacetaminophen\\n(Datril, Tylenol, Panadol) for fever andpain.

Other steroids are inhaled. Long-term steroid\\nuse can have serious side effects. Other drugs, such as\\nipratropium (Atrovent), are given to reduce the quan-\\ntity of mucus produced.\\nAs the disease progresses, the patient may need\\nsupplemental oxygen. Complications of COPD are\\nmany and often require hospitalization in the latter\\nstages of the disease.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative practitioners focus on prevention by\\neating a healthy diet that strengthens the immune\\nsystem and practicingstress management. Bronchitis\\ncan become serious if it progresses to pneumonia,\\ntherefore, antibiotics may be required. In addition,\\nhowever, there are a multitude of botanical and herbal\\nmedicines that can be formulated to treat bronchitis.\\nSome examples include inhaling eucalyptus or other\\nessential oils in warm steam. Herbalists recommend a\\ntea made of mullein (Verbascum thapsus), coltsfoot\\n(Tussilago farfara), and anise seed (Pimpinella ani-\\nsum). Homeopathic medicine and traditional Chinese\\nmedicine may also be very useful for bronchitis, and\\nhydrotherapy can contribute to cleaning the chest and\\nstimulating immune response.\\nPrognosis\\nWhen treated, acute bronchitis normally resolves\\nin one to two weeks without complications, although\\na cough may continue for several more weeks. The\\nprogression of chronic bronchitis, on the other hand,\\nmay be slowed, and an initial improvement in symp-\\ntoms may be achieved. Unfortunately, however,\\nthere is no cure for chronic bronchitis, and the disease\\ncan often lead to or coexist with emphysema. Taken\\ntogether, all forms of COPD are a leading cause of\\ndeath.\\nPrevention\\nThe best way to prevent bronchitis is not to begin\\nsmoking or to stop smoking. Smokers are ten times\\nmore likely to die of COPD than non-smokers.\\nSmokers who stop show improvement in lung func-\\ntion. Other preventative steps include avoiding\\nchemical and environmental irritants, such as air\\npollution, and maintaining good overall health.\\nImmunizations against certain types of pneumonia\\n(as well asinfluenza) are an important preventative\\nmeasure for anyone with lung or immune system\\ndiseases.\\nResources\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nAmerican Lung Association. 1740 Broadway, New York,\\nNY 10019.

Breathing out (exhal-\\ning) happens automatically when the person stops\\nbreathing in. In a person with asthma, breathing in\\n(inhaling) is not a problem. Incoming air can slide\\naround the blockage, because the act of breathing in\\nmakes the airways expand. The problem comes when\\nthe person with asthma tries to breathe out. The air can\\nno longer get past the blockage, and it remains trapped\\nin the lungs. The person can then only take shallow\\nbreaths. Bronchodilators work by relaxing the smooth\\nmuscles that line the airways. This makes the airways\\nopen wider and allows air to leave the lungs. These drugs\\nalso are used to relieve breathing problems associated\\nwithemphysema, chronic bronchitis, and other lung\\ndiseases.\\nDescription\\nSome bronchodilators are inhaled, using a nebulizer\\nor an inhalation aerosol. Others are taken as injections\\nor by mouth. Most are available only by prescription,\\nbut a few, such as ephedrine, can be bought without\\na physician’s prescription.

In studies of laboratory animals,\\nsome bronchodilators cause birth defects or miscar-\\nriage when the animals are given doses many times\\nthe usual human dose. Whether these drugs cause such\\nproblems in humans in unknown. Any woman who is\\npregnant or plans to become pregnant should check\\nwith her physician before using a bronchodilator.\\nBREASTFEEDING. Some bronchodilators pass into\\nbreast milk. Breastfeeding mothers should check with\\ntheir physicians before using bronchodilators.\\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using\\nbronchodilators, people with any of these medical\\nproblems should make sure their physicians are\\naware of their conditions:\\n/C15glaucoma\\n/C15brain damage\\n/C15convulsions (seizures)—recently or anytime in the\\npast\\n/C15mental illness\\n/C15parkinson’s disease\\n/C15diabetes\\n/C15heart or blood vessel diseases\\n/C15rapid or irregular heartbeat\\n/C15high blood pressure\\n/C15overactive thyroid\\n/C15enlarged prostate\\n/C15obstruction of the neck of the bladder\\nUSE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Using bronchodila-\\ntors with certain other drugs may affect the way the\\ndrugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.\\nSide effects\\nSome patients have a dry or irritated throat or a\\ndry mouth after using bronchodilators. To help pre-\\nvent these problems, gargling and rinsing the mouth or\\ntaking a sip of water after each dose.\\nThe most common side effects are nervousness or\\nrestlessness and trembling. These problems usually go\\naway as the body adjusts to the drug and do not\\nrequire medical treatment. Less common side effects,\\nsuch as bad taste in the mouth, coughing, dizziness or\\nlightheadedness, drowsiness,headache, sweating, fast\\nor pounding heartbeat, muscle cramps or twitches,\\nnausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sleep problems and weak-\\nness also may occur and do not need medical attention\\nunless they do not go away or they interfere with\\nnormal activities.\\nMore serious side effects are not common, but\\nmay occur. If any of the following side effects occur,\\nthe physician who prescribed the medicine should be\\ncontacted as soon as possible:\\n/C15chest pain or discomfort\\n/C15irregular or fluttery heartbeat\\n/C15unusual bruising\\n/C15hives or rash\\n/C15swelling\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 669\\nBronchodilators'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20250509125200', 'source': 'Data/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'total_pages': 700, 'page': 699, 'page_label': '700'}, page_content='/C15wheezing or other breathing problems\\n/C15numbness in the hands or feet\\n/C15blurred vision\\nOther side effects are possible.

Odle\\nBronchoscopy\\nDefinition\\nBronchoscopy is a procedure in which a cylindri-\\ncal fiberoptic scope is inserted into the airways. This\\nscope contains a viewing device that allows the visual\\nexamination of the lower airways.\\nPurpose\\nDuring a bronchoscopy, a physician can visually\\nexamine the lower airways, including the larynx, tra-\\nchea, bronchi, and bronchioles. The procedure is used\\nto examine the mucosal surface of the airways for\\nabnormalities that might be associated with a variety\\nof lung diseases. Its use includes the visualization of\\nairway obstructions such as a tumor, or the collection\\nof specimens for the diagnosis ofcancer originating in\\nthe bronchi of the lungs (bronchogenic cancer). It can\\nalso be used to collect specimens for culture to diag-\\nnose infectious diseases such astuberculosis. The type\\nof specimens collected can include sputum (composed\\nof saliva and discharges from the respiratory pas-\\nsages), tissue samples from the bronchi or bronchioles,\\nor cells collected from washing the lining of the\\nbronchi or bronchioles. The instrument used in\\nbronchoscopy, a bronchoscope, is a slender cylindrical\\ninstrument containing a light and an eyepiece. There\\nare two types of bronchoscopes, a rigid tube that is\\nsometimes referred to as an open-tube or ventilating\\nbronchoscope, and a more flexible fiberoptic tube.\\nThis tube contains four smaller passages—two for\\nlight to pass through, one for seeing through and one\\nthat can accommodate medical instruments that may\\nbe used for biopsy or suctioning, or that medication\\ncan be passed through.\\n670 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nBronchoscopy')]\n"
